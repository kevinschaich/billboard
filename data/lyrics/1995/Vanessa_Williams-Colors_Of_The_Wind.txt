You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life
Has a spirit
Has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew
You never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grin
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once
Never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle
In a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow
If you cut it down
Then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or whether we are white or copper skin
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colours of the wind
