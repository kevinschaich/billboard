You don't know how you took it
You just know what you got
Oh lordy, you've been stealing from the thieves
And you got caught

In the headlights of a stretch car
You're a star

Dressing like your sister
Living like a tart
They don't know what you're doing
Babe, it must be art

You're a headache in a suitcase
You're a star

Oh no, don't be shy
You don't have to go blind
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me

You don't know how you got here
You just know you want out
Believing in yourself
Almost as much as you doubt

You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash
Star

Oh no, don't be shy
There's a crowd to cry
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me

Hey, oh oh

They want you to be Jesus
They'll go down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at thirty-three

And you're turning tricks with your crucifix
You're a star, oh child

Of course you're not shy
You don't have to deny love
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me
