It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue 
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day 
And I love you so, how much you'll never know 
You've gone away and left me lonely 

Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me 
Another love so true 
That once turned all my gray skies blue 
But you disappeared 
Now my eyes are filled with tears 
And I'm wishing you were here with me 

Soft with love are my thoughts of you 
Now that you're gone 
I just don't know what to do 

If only you were here 
You'd wash away my tears 
The sun would shine once again 
You'd be mine all mine 
But in reality, you and I will never be 
'Cause you took your love away from me 


Girl, I don't know what I did 
To make you leave me 
But what I do know 
Is that since you've been gone 
There's such an emptiness inside 
I'm wishing you'd come back to me 

If only you were here 
You'd wash away my tears 
The sun would shine once again 
You'd be mine all mine 
But in reality, you and I will never be 
'Cause you took your love away from me 

Oh, baby, you took your love away from me.
