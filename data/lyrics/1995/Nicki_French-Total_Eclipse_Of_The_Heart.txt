Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around 
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears 
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by 
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes 
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 

And I need you now tonight 
And I need you more than ever 
And if you'll only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever 
And we'll only be making it right 
Cause we'll never be wrong together 

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 
There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart 

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be 
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am 
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you 
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do 
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 

And I need you now tonight 
And I need you more than ever 
And if you'll only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever 
And we'll only be making it right 
Cause we'll never be wrong together 
We can take it to the end of the line 
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time 
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark 
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks 
I really need you tonight 
Forever's gonna start tonight 
Forever's gonna start tonight 

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 
There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart 
Once upon a time there was light in my life 
But now there's only love in the dark 
Nothing I can say 
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark 
Now there's only love in the dark 
Now there's only love in the dark 
Now there's only love in the dark 
A total eclipse of the heart
Now there's only love in the dark 
Now there's only love in the dark 
Now there's only love in the dark 

A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 
There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart 

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 
There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart
