She sits alone by a lampost
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says "Dad's the one I love the most,
But Stipe's not far behind"

She never lets me in
Only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I said that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away
And just

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying "baby, maybe I'll be back someday"
I wanted to look for you
You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer
And felt sorry for myself, sayin'

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her be

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Ahh...

Last night, I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'
"Oh mama, please help me!
Won't you hold my hand and...?"

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Oh, let her be.
