Why drink the water from my hand
Contagious as you think I am?
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
Don't worry 'bout, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am?
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
Don't worry 'bout, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
Don't worry 'bout, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
Don't worry 'bout, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
Don't worry 'bout, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head, now baby, just spit me out
