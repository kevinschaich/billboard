Verse:
I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to (wake up) and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be, a better way
Say it again, a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me
Chorus:
Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

Verse:
All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure enough couldn't have survived without you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me

Chorus
