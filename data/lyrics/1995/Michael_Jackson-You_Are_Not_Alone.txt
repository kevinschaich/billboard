Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be, you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone
Alone, all alone, why, alone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And, girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

You are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

You are not alone, you are not alone
Said again, you are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
Did you raise for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone
Together, together
