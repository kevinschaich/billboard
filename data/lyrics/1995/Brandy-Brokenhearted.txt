I'm young but I'm wise
Enough to know that you
Don't fall in love over night
That's why I thought if I
Took my time that everything
In love would be right
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was sayin' to love Goodbye

But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

No more empty conversation
Next time I will be totally sure
Don't want the pain of falling
In and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure
So I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry

But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

While I'm lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
Da Da Da
Oh Ya
Da Da Da Da Da
Wow Ya
A Da, Oohh

I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
