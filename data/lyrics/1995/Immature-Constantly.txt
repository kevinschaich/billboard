Chorus:
Constantly
Constantly
Constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind

Verse 1:
At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I cant get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
Often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend

Hook:
If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Chorus:
Constantly
I've got you on my mind(Constantly babe)
Constantly
And not just all the time, i think about you
Constantly
If you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind

Verse 2:
I practice my words
And I build up the nerve
But uh
Words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye
Time after time
Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind

Hook:
If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Chorus:
Constantly
Your always on my mind
Constantly
And not just all the time, I think about you
Constantly
Oh if you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind

I think about you baby

Your always on my mind
Constantly(OoOh Yeah Constantly Baby)
Constantly(Whoa i think about you, i think about you)
Constantly(When i wake up in the morning,When i go to bed at night..)
Constantly(I think about you all the time, Constantly your on my mind)
Constantly(yeah yeah yeah, constantly i want you baby, please come to me)
