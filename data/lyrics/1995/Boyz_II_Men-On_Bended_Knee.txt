And I....

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, Im sorry. 
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl. 
I know you put all your trust
in me, I'm sorry I let you down. 
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
it can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
