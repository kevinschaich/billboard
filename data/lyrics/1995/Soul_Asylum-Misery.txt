They say misery
Loves company
We could start a company
And make misery

Frustrated Incorporated

Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

Put me out of my misery
I'd do it for you, would you do it for me?
We will always be busy making misery

We could build a factory
And make misery
We'll create the cure
We made the disease

Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

Put me out of my misery
All you suicide kings and your drama queens
Forever after happily
Making misery

Did you satisfy your greed
Get what you need?
Was it only envy?
So empty
