I can't stop this feelin'
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me

When you hold me in your arms so tight
You let me know everything's alright

I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
High on believin'
That you're in love with me

Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
Girl, you keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine

I got it bad for you, girl
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure

All the good love when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on

I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
High on believin'
That you're in love with me

All the good love when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on

I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
