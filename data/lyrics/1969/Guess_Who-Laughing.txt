I should laugh, but I cry
Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize
That I was waiting

Time goes slowly but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize
That you were laughing

(Laughing)
'Cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing)
It ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

(Laughing)
'Cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing)
It ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

I go alone now, calling your name
After losing at the game
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize
That you were laughing

Time goes slowly but carries on
And now the best years, the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize
That you were laughing

(Laughing)
'Cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing)
It ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

(Laughing)
'Cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing)
What you doin' to me?
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me, ooh

(Laughing)
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha
(Laughing)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
(Laughing)
Well, you're laughing at me
(Laughing)
Well, you're laughing at me
(Laughing)
What you doin' to me, girl?
(Laughing)
I'm looking, you're laughing
(Laughing)
I'm looking, you're laughing
(Laughing)
You're looking, I'm laughing
(Laughing)
I'm laughing
