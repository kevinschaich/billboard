You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby
I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age, Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

She's leavin' now cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby
For God sake's turn around
