From Atlanta, Georgia, to the Gulf Stream water,
up to California end I'm gonna spend my life both night and day, 
I say, gimme, gimme good lovin' every night.
(Hey you know it's alright, child)
Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

To the girls in Frisco, to the girls in New York,
To the girls in Texican, you gotta understand,
That baby I'm your man
I say, gimme, gimme good lovin' every night.
(Yeah you know it's alright now)
Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
