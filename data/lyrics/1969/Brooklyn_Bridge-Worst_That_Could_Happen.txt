Girl, I heard you're getting married
Heard you're getting married, this time you're really sure
And this is the end, they say you really mean it
This guy's the one that makes you feel so safe
So sane and so secure

And baby, if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me

I'll never get married, never get married
You know that's not my scene
But a girl like you needs to be married
I've known all along you couldn't live forever in between

And baby, if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me

And girl, I don't really blame you
For having a dream of your own
Hey girl, I don't really blame you
A woman like you needs a house and a home, baby

If he really loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen

Oh girl, don't wanna get married
Girl, I'm never, never gonna marry, no no
No, it's the worst that could happen
The worst that could happen
Oh girl, the worst that could happen
