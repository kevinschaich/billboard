End of the spring
And here she comes back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there
Them summer days
Those summer days

That's when I had
Most of my fun, back
High, high, high, high there
Them summer days
Those summer days

I cloud nine when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything is true
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime

First of the fall
And then she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there
Them summer days
Those summer days

Boop-boop-boop-boop
When I want to
Out of school
County fair in the country sun
And everything is cool
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
