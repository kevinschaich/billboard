You really should accept
This time he's gone for good
He'll never come back now
Even though he said he would
So darling dry your eyes
So many other guys
Would give the world I'm sure
To wear the shoes he wore

Oh, c'mon 
Smile a little smile for me, Rosemarie
Where's the use in cryin'?
In a little while you'll see, Rosemarie
You must keep on tryin'

I know that he hurt you bad
I know darling don't be sad and
Smile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie

I guess you're lonely now
Love's comin' to an end
But darling only now
Are you free to start again
Lift up your pretty chin
Don't let those tears begin
You're a big girl now
And you'll pull through somehow

Oh, c'mon 
Smile a little smile for me, Rosemarie
Where's the use in cryin'?
In a little while you'll see, Rosemarie
You must keep on tryin'

I know that he hurt you bad
I know darling don't be sad and
Smile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie

Bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah
Bah bah
Bah bah bah bah

Smile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie
