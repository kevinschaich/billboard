Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

Ooh ooh

Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain so don't be blue
'cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be yeah

So baby straighten up come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe yeah
I said now baby baby don't cry
Baby baby here's why
Love is here standin' by
Love is here standin' by

You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of

Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can never stop him now no no no
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now yeah

Oowee now baby baby don't cry no no
Baby baby here's why
Because love is here standin' by
I say Love is here standin' by

All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope girl love is strength
Here's someone standin' right beside ya
Who would go to any length to give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

So baby baby don't cry Oh baby don't you cry now
Baby baby don't cry Oh baby let me tell you why now
Baby baby here's why don't you know that
Love is here standin' by
I say love is here standin' by

Your tears are shed in vain I said
So baby baby don't cry c'mon dry your eyes

Baby baby don't cry don't you realize
Baby baby here's why
