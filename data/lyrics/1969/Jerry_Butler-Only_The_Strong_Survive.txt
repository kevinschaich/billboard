I see you sittin' there all alone
Crying your eyes out
While everything's going wrong
You know there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
Listen to me, get up off your knees
'Cause only the strong survive

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Hey, you gotta be strong
You gotta hold on
I said don't give up, no don't

I said don't go around
With your head looking down
Dont you let'em make you feel like a clown
There's a lot of opportunity
Out there just waiting for you
But you'll never succeed if you've given up
And say your life is through
Listen this minute what I'm tellin' you

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Hey, you gotta be strong
Gotta hold on
You gotta be a man, take a stand

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive

Weak fall by the wayside
You gotta hold on
You gotta keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on gettin' on

'Cause only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Weak fall by the wayside
You gotta be strong
You gotta hold on
You gotta keep goin' on

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Weak fall by the wayside
You gotta be a man
You gotta take a stand

Get up, set your body in motion
You knnw the strong survive
Wake up and get your education
So you can keep your family alive
Get away from negative situations
It can only bring you a lot of frustrations
'Cause only the strong survive

Hey, you gotta be strong
Gotta hold on
You gotta be a man, take a stand

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
