Good morning starshine
The earth says "hello"
You twinkle above us
We twinkle below

Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singing song

Gliddy glup gloopy
Nibby nabby noopy la la la lo lo
Sabba sibby sabba

Nooby abba nabba le le lo lo
Tooby ooby walla nooby abba nabba
Early morning singing song

Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singing song

Gliddy glup gloopy
Nibby nabby noopy la la la lo lo
Sabba sibby sabba

Nooby abba nabba le le lo lo
Tooby ooby walla nooby abba nabba
Early morning singing song

Singing a song, humming a song
Singing a song, loving a song
Laughing a song

Sing the song, sing the song
Song the sing
Song, song, song, sing
Sing, sing, sing, song
