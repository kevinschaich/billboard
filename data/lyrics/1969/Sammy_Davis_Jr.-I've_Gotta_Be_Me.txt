Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong 
Whether I find a place in this world or never belong 
I gotta be me, I've gotta be me 
What else can I be but what I am  

I want to live, not merely survive 
And I won't give up this dream 
Of life that keeps me alive 
I gotta be me, I gotta be me 
The dream that I see makes me what I am 

That far-away prize, a world of success 
Is waiting for me if I heed the call 
I won't settle down, won't settle for less 
As long as there's a chance that I can have it all 

I'll go it alone, that's how it must be 
I can't be right for somebody else 
If I'm not right for me 
I gotta be free, I've gotta be free 
Daring to try, to do it or die 
I've gotta be me 

I'll go it alone, that's how it must be 
I can't be right for somebody else 
If I'm not right for me 
I gotta be free, I just gotta be free 
Daring to try, to do it or die 
I gotta be me
