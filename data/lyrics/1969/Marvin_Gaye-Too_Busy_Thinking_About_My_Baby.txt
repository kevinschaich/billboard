Uh-huh huh, oh yeah, Oh listen to me people...

I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdy fly
And I don't have the time
To think about what makes a flower grow
And I never gave it second thought
Of where the river flows

Background: Too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby
Marvin: And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Oh yeah, now...

I said uh I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's gonna' last
And uh I ain't got time
To do no studyin'
Once I get out of class
I tell you I'm just a guy
Who has a one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time

Background: Too busy thinkin' bout my baby
Marvin: And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Don't you know I'm too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Background: Oooh-Oooh, Oooh-Oooh
Marvin(during background vocals): Yeah, yeah

Marvin: All the diamonds and pearls
In the world
Could never match her worth
Naw, she's some kinda' wonderful people tell ya'
I've got heaven right here on earth
I'm, just a fella
With a one, one track mind
Background: Oh yeah
And when it comes to thinkin' 'bout anything but my baby...
I just don't have the time

Background: Too busy thinkin' bout my baby
Marvin: Oh, and I ain't got time for nothin' else
You know it
Background and Marvin: Too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby
And I ain't got time for nothin' else

Background: Too busy thinkin' about my baby
Ain't got time for nothin' else, no no
Marvin: Oh yeah
Background: (repeating above to end)
Marvin: Oh...
She's never hard to find
'Cause she's always on my mind
