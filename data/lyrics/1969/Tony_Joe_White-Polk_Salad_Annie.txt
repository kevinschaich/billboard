Now some of y'all never been down South too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand
What I'm talking about

Down there we have a plant that grows out 
In the woods and the fields
Looks somethin' like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad, polk salad, huh
Used to know a girl that lived down there and 
She'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

Down in Louisiana 
Where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was working on a chain-gang
A mean, vicious woman

Now, everyday 'fore supper time 
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess o' polk salad 
And carry it home in a tote sack

Polk salad Annie 
The gators got you granny
(Chomp, chomp, chomp)
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her mama was a-workin' on a chain gang
A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have mercy, pick a mess of it

Her daddy was lazy and no count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for 
Was stealin' watermelons out of my truck patch

Polk salad Annie
The gators got your granny
(Woo hoo)
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on a chain gang

Sock a little polk salad to me
Know I need a mess of it
Ooh, good God
Got to have me
