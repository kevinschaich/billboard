I know that it's late and I really must leave you alone
But you're too good to hold that I feel such a long way from home
Yes I know that our love is too new, but I promise it's going to be true
Please let me stay and don't you send me away, oh no, no

Aaaah
Tell me baby that you need me, say you'll never leave me
Love me tonight

Hold me now my heart is aching, untill the dawn is breaking
Love me tonight

Something is burning inside, something that can't be denied
I can't let you out of my sight, darling
Love me tonight

Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Baby, love me tonight

I' ve waited so long for the girl of my dreams to appear
And now I can hardly believe that you really are here
Here in my arms you belong, how can this feeling be wrong
Darling be kind for I' m out of my mind over you

Aaaahh
Tell me baby, that you need me, say you'll never leave me
Love me tonight

Baby now the pain is stronger, I can't wait a moment longer
Love me tonight

Something is burning inside, something that can't be denied
I can't let you out of my sight darling
Love me tonight

Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Baby, love me tonight
Love me to-ni-i-i-i-i-i-ight!!
