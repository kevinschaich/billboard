Bloom-Cordell-Gentry

I can still remember 
It wasn't long ago. 
Things you used to tell me, 
You said I had to know. 
Told me that you loved me 
And that you always would. 
Then I said I loved you. 
You said that that was good. 
Girl, you made a promise, said you'd never want me to go. 
Oh no! 
Indian giver, Indian giver, 
You took your love away from me. 
Indian giver, Indian giver, 
Took back the love you gave to me. 
Baby, I was feeling 
The way I want to feel. 
You had me believing 
The love we had was real. 
Things we did together 
You said they'd never end. 
"Now until forever." Yeah, that was what you said. 
Girl, when I was down, I knew you'd always be there. 
Oh, yeah! 
Indian giver, Indian giver, 
You took your love away from me. 
Indian giver, Indian giver, 
Took back the love you gave to me
