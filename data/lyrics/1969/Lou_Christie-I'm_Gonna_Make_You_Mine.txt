I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take
Everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll try to get to your soul
I'll try to get to your mind
I'm gonna make you mine

I know I'll never give up
I'm at the end of my rope
From the morning 'til supper time
And you'll find 
I'll be waiting in line
I'll be waiting in line
I'm gonna make you mine

Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take
Everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll be waiting in line
I'll be waiting in line
'Cause I'm gonna make you mine

Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

I'll be a hard lovin', pushin' kinda, uh, individual
Knocking night and day at your door
You'll have to turn me away
Like a indestructible force

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take
Everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll try to get to your soul
I'll try to get to your mind
'Cause I'm gonna make you mine.

Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
