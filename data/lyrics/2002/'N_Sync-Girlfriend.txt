Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?

Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?

I don't know why you care (Why you thinkin' bout him, mamma?)
He doesn't even know you're there, no
'Cause he don't love your eyes (No)
And he don't love your smile (No)
Girl, you know that ain't fair (C'mon)

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear

And, baby, when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

Why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good, girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should

'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend

Does he know what you feel?
Are you sure that it's real, yeah? (Are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind?
Or does he break your stride?
Did you know that love could be a shield yeah

In the middle of the night (Ooohooo)
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear

And, baby, when you cry (Oho)
Is he gonna stand by your side? (No, no)
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea (Listen, girl)

So won't you be my girlfriend? (Yeah, yeah)
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good, girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should, baby

'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah

I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend, oh!

(Hey, why don't ya)
Won't you be my girlfriend (Yeah)
I'll treat you good
I know you hear your friends when they say you should

'Cause if you were my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
I'd be your shining star (Yeaheah)
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend (You make my heart sing)

(You make my heart sing)

My baby, baby, yeah) (You make my heart sing)
(Girl, you should be) My girlfriend

Girl, you should be my girlfriend
