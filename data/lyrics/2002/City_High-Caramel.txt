You can say I'm plain Jane, but it's not the same
I ain't in to big names, but I like nice things
I watch boxing matches and uh football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress, but I love to sing
I like going out, taking walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home I curl up next to ya
You know I ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm having sex with ya

Cuz anywhere I go I'm spotted
And anything I want I got it
5'5" with brown eyes
(caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise

Cuz anywhere I go I'm spotted
And anything I want I got it
5'5" with brown eyes
(caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise

Baby look me in the eyes
And tell me if
I'm the kinda girl you like
I'm feeling you
Cuz sweetie you're my kinda guy
That's what it is
Think about it you just might
wanna run with this
All night long
And if you want me we can keep this going
Let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men I'm independent
I ain't like some other women

Cuz anywhere I go I'm spotted
And anything I want I got it
5'5" with brown eyes
Smile like the sunrise

Cuz anywhere I go I'm spotted
And anything I want I got it
5'5" with brown eyes
Smile like the sunrise

Ven aquí, Ven aquí, mamá
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
See we could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5" brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile got me hypnotized

(Singing in Spanish)
Mira (so can i get your number or something)
Mi amor mirame bien
Te encantará
Si quisieras lo tendrás (i dunno what you said but i like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada
lo que me veo lo consigo
Piel morena, ojos negros
y sonrisa soleada

Cuz I go I'm spotted
And anything I want I got it
5'5" with brown eyes
Smile like the sunrise (4x)
5'5" with brown eyes
smile like the sunrise
(2x)

Note: "Ven aquí" means "come here" in Spanish.
