I am so high, I can hear Heaven
I am so high, I can hear Heaven
Oh, but Heaven, no, Heaven don't hear me

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

Someone told me love would all save us
But how can that be? Look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away, ah-hah

Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

And they're watchin' us (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away
And they're watchin' us (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away, yeah (Yeah)
And they're watchin' us  (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
