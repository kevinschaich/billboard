Just somethin' about you  
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me  
Gettin' scared now, right  
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin  
It feel good right, listen  

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine  
If it's up to me your face'll change  

If you smile then that should set the tone  
Just be limber 
And if you let go the music should move your bones  
Just remember  

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony  
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so is datin'  
Love you or they're hatin'  
When it doesn't matter anyway  
'Cause we're here tonight  

If you smile then that should set the tone  
Just be limber baby 
And if you let go the music should move your bones  
Baby, just remember  

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch ya  

Yeah  
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life  
If you give me that chance to be your man 
I won't let you down baby  
If you give me that chance to be your man 
Here baby, hold my jacket  
And then...  

Maybe we'll fly the night away   
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby)  
Girl....

(Pusha T)  
Ma' whatcha wanna do?  
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two  
Or me and you put on a stage show  
And the mall kids, that's how to change low  
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'  
Point to me I say 'Yea, it's the same dough'  
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night  

(Malice)  
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best  
Take a few shots  
Let it burn in your chest  
We could ride down  
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck  
Funny how a few words turn into sex 
(I just love your...brain...)  
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain' 
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away 
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl..  
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)  

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya 
(Can't love ya like I do)  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)  
Late at night I talk to you (hey) 
You will know the difference when I...

(Break it down)  

You know  
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy  
I never thought it would end up this way 
Drums... (hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah  
You know, if you think about it  
Sometimes people are just destined  
Destined to do what they do  
And that's what it is  

Now everybody dance
