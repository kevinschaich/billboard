Hot in
So hot in herre
So hot in, ah
Oh!

Wanna a little bit-a
And a little bit-a
Check a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
I'm lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys

Then, um, I'm leavin' please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check in, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and no teasin'

I need you to get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you
And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby, tell me, what's the use?
I said

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, it's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, I do a hundred, top down and goggles

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it

Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank-top on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dancin' in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, girl, I think my ass gettin' big

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Mix a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
(Let it hang all out)

With a little bit-a...
And a sprinkle of that...
Let it just fall out
I like it when ya...
Girl, baby make it...

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I got a friend with a pole in the basement (What?)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it

Extra, extra, spread the news
Check it: Nelly took a trip from the lunar to Neptune
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she like to think about cuttin' in restrooms

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Mix a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
(Let it hang all out)
With a little bit-a...
And a sprinkle of that...
(Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya...
Girl, baby make it...

Oh
