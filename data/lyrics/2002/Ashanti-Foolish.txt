See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why
You're treating me so bad (treating me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had

And though my heart is beatin' for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how
I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay 

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why
Ya wanna do me wrong (do me wrong)
See when I'm home, I'm all alone 
And you are always gone (always gone)

And boy, you know I really love you 
I can't deny 
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears 
After all these years 

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Ohh
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad 
What love will make you do 

All the things that we accept 
Be the things that we regret 
To all of my ladies (ladies)
Feel me, c'mon sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave 
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you

So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me 
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up

Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back
