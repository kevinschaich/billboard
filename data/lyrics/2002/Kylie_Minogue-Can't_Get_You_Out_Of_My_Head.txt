La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about
Every night, every day, just to be there in your arms

Won't you stay... won't you lay?
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever...

La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about
There's a dark secret in me, don't leave me locked in your heart

Set me free... feel the need in me... set me free
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever...

La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
(I just can't get you out of my head)
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
(I just can't get you out of my head)

La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
(I just can't get you out of my head)
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
(I just can't get you out of my head)
La la la, la la la la la, la la la, la la la la la
