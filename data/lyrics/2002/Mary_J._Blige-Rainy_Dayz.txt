Hey, yeah
Rule baby, yeah
Mary J. Blige

Smile

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

We were always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we began to love it (began to love it)
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin' of it (thinkin' nothin' of it)
And baby, I got a love for you
And I know that you got me, baby
But everytime the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before
About chasin' those waterfalls
Chasin' waterfalls
Yeah

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, what did we tell ya before 
About chasin' those waterfalls

Yeah

Yeah, baby
Sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, and give me a reason to keep on believin'
That everything ain't misleadin'
And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you, when the skies are gray
Babe, cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I mastered it, Lord knows why

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion, the pain, and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah

Makin' clothes for all of those 
That spread the love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer

Nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before
About chasin' those waterfalls
Chasin' waterfalls

Yeah

Nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, what did we tell ya before 
About chasin' those waterfalls

Yeah

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile
Til the sun shines
Just smile for me
Just smile for me, just smile at me
Know in your heart, that we are free
Free to believe, whatever we feel
So feel somethin' real, baby
Hey
