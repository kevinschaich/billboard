Just gimme the light and pass the draw
Bust another bottle of moe
Gal them inna me sight and I gots to know...
Which one is gonna catch my flow
Cause I'm inna the vibes and I got my dough
Bust another bottle of moe
Gal them lookin' and I gots to know

Could I be your protector
You buff in every sector
Every man around them
Want turn your inspector
But you no let them sweat ya
Nor grill you with no lecture
Bout them power dirll
Or them fuel injector
Them a infector disease collector
Nuff a them a gwaan like them want come
Wreck ya... Done out the part weh you got in
A you center... But you know you no let them
Guy de affect ya
Yo 

Just gimme the light and pass the draw
Bust another bottle of moe
Gal them inna me sight and I gots to know...

Cause I'm inna the vibes and I got my dough
Bust another bottle of moe

Situation gettin' really live again
Gal them want fi hang out with
The players and the riders them
Beside of them... And them say them tired of
The liars them... Friars and connivers them...
