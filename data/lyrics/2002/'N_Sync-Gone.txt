There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

Now,I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no,no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day 
But baby I don't want to 

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

What will I do if I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to baby who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart? 
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains
But the truth remains
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

But the truth remains you're...
