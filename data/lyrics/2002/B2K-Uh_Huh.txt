Yo, where you at? 

Girl you messed up when you let me in 
Told your best friend that you wanted me 
Then she called me up and hipped me to your steez 
Told me that you were lookin' for a guy like me 
So I said hold on, I ain't the one
Unless shorty really wanna have some fun 
Then she said that you told her I was what you want 
When I call you don't try to front(uh huh) 

I'm the guy in your dreams (that you had last night) 
I'm the benz wit tha 20'z (that you wanna drive) 
I'm tha thug in your life (that'll treat you right) 
Got ya hooked cuz I'm bringing everything you like 

chorus 
Uh huh

Now we're all out in the open 
Everybody knows about you and me 
Ain't no more need for you and me to creep 
I want you so bad I don't care who sees 
So girl hold on, I got what you want 
I know you ain't scared to go n have some fun 
So let your girlfriends know that you found someone 
Who'll be keepin' you tight and sprung (uh huh)

I'm tha guy in your dreams (that you had last night) 
I'm benz wit tha 20's (that you wanna drive) 
I'm tha thug in your life (that'll treat you right)

chorus 

Two months of conversation 
Man it's a major 
Split tha game undercover 
I'm lethal like Danny Glover 
Got you runnin' to your mother 
Makin' plans for life 
Yo, I'm only 15 what I need wit a wife? 
We can walk through tha mall while I hold ya hips 
Or you can hang out tha drop while I'm pushin' tha whip 
Take you on a ride you will never forget 
Runnin' home, tellin' your friends lil' Fizz is it 
Got ya hooked by tha way that I lick my lips 
And I got many dimes, I ain't sweatin' dis chick 
Yo, I run these girls from coast to coast 
Dropin' game so sick I got 'em doin' tha most (uh huh)
