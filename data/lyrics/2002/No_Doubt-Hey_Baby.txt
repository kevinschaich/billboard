Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt

Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby

Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby

When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Now, if now maybe

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady?

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
When you rock your hips
You know that it amaze me

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back
