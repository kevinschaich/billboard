Now I was down town clubbin, ladies night, 
Seen shorty she was crazy right,
And I approach baby like,
Ma, What's your age and type?,
She looked at me and said you's a baby right?,
I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like,
And I know what the ladies like,
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice,
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe,
Come with me come stay the night,
She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight,
I'm laughin back like sure you're right,
Get in the car,
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car,
Lets discuss somethin',
Either we lovin or I'll see you tomorrow,
Now we speedin' up the westside, 
Hand creepin' up her left side,  ready to do it,
Ready to bone, ready for dome,

Told me to acknowledge her quick,

They all say i'm rotten and rich,
But not her, boo be's real,
High heel dooby feel, plus got them gucci nails, uh,
You a cutie still, and this my down girl too,
Ain't no groupie deal,
We left the movies with Uzies, Suzuki wheels,
To the jacuzzi, I tell you my boo be's real,

Go to the crib she got the gucci linen,
I see boo be grinning,
She looked and said Cam, I know that you be sinnin',
Naw, I'm a changed man, look at the range mam,
I got a whole new game plan, 
Looked and said that's nothing but game Cam,
She was right; she was up in the range man, 
Droped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell,
That's right I had to call up L,
