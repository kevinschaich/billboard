Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
It feels like forever

Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh, I remember

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant

It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

My sacrifice
