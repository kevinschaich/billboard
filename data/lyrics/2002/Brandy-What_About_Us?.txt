Oooh!
Yeah, darkchild
B-rock, let's go

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (What?)

What the hell, I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need your pity

I will, be just fine
If you decide, that you want to leave
Close the, door behind you
I just, want to know what

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about)
What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about us?)

Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (What?)

What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
'Cause you're counterfeit, I see

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity

I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about)
What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about us?)

Baby, check it out hear this
Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game we play, I picked it
Now what if I said it wasn't true, so do you
You and I know without me there's no you

So what about bills that were past due, paid for you
All you say to me is: "Baby, I owe you" (Aha)
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Don't what about us to me 'cause we are through

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? 

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about)
What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about us?)
