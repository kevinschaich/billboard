Never win first place,
I don't support the team,
I can't take direction and my socks are never clean.

Teachers dated me
My parents hated me
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothin' right

Every day I fought a war against the mirror,
I can't take the person starin' back at me.

I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more,
I wanna be somebody else
I wanna be somebody else, yeah

L.A. told me,
"You'll be a pop star.
All you have to change
Is everything you are"

Tired of being compared
To damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty,
That just ain't me

So doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin'?
A day in the life of someone else

'Cause I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me (no)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself

So irritating (no).
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else (yeah)
Don't let me get me (don't let me)
I'm my own worst enemy (oh)
It's bad when you annoy yourself

So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more, 
I wanna be somebody else

So doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin'?
A day in the life of someone else
Don't let me get me


Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah
Don't let me get me.
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself (yourself)

So irritating (so irritating). 
Don't wanna be my friend no more (don't, don't)
I wanna be somebody else

Don't let me get me (don't let, don't let) 
I'm my own worst enemy (don't let me get me),
It's bad when you annoy yourself (it's bad, it's so bad).

So irritating (oh)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (I)
I wanna be somebody else. 

(Don't let me get me, don't let me get me)
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself.
