A new day has come
A new day has come

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

(Hush, love) I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched 
By an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
(A new day has come)
(A new day has come)

Where it was dark now there’s light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

(Hush, love) I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I’ve been touched 
By an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
(A new day has come)
(A new day has come)

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

Hush, love, I see a light in your eyes
I can't believe I’ve been touched 
By an angel with love

I can't believe I’ve been touched 
By an angel with love

Ohohoho

Hush now
I see a light in your eyes
