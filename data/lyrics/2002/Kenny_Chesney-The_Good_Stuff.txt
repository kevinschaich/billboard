Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep 
Down at the end lookin' half asleep 
He walked up and said "What'll it be?"
I said,"The good stuff"
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said, "You can't find that here."

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Your momma's all worried when you get home late
Droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said,
"I'll have some of that."
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, "That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed."
He said, "Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying "I'm a grandpa"
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He said, "When you get home she'll start to cry,
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Then look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff
