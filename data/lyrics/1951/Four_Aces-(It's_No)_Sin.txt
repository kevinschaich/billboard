Take away the breath of flowers
It would surely be a sin
Take the rain from April showers
It's a sin

Take away the violins, dear
From a lovely symphony
And the music deep within
Would cease to be

Is it a sin to love you so
To hold you close
And know you are leaving

Though you take away my heart, dear
Still the beating there within
I'll keep loving you forever
For it's no sin

Is it a sin to love you so
To hold you close
And know you are leaving

Though you take away my heart, dear
Still the beating there within
I'll keep loving you forever
For it's no sin
