Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with every sweet desire

Be my love and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all that I need to seal my fate
And, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally
If you will be my love

(Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create)
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire

(Be my love and with your kisses) set me burning
One kiss is all that I need to seal my fate
And, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally
If you will be my love
