If they made me a king
I'd be but a slave to you
If I had everything
I'd still be a slave to you

If I ruled the night
Stars and moon so bright
Still I'd turn for light to you

If the world to me bowed
Yet humbly I'd flee to you
If my friends were a crowd
I'd turn in my need to you

If I ruled the earth
What would life be worth
If I hadn't the right to you

If I ruled the night
Stars and moon so bright
Still I'd turn for light to you

If the world to me bowed
Yet humbly I'd flee to you
If my friends were a crowd
I'd turn in my need to you

If I ruled the earth
What would life be worth
If I hadn't the right to you
