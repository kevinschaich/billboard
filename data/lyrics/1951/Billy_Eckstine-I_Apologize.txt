If I told a lie, if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize

If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Must have been insane, believe me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize

I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than friends

Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize

If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
