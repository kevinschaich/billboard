If ever a devil was born
Without a pair of horns
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Grieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

If ever a devil was born
Without a pair of horns
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Grieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

Even had I never known
A lover such as you
Forsaking dreams and goals
For the silent scorn
Of your charms, Jezebel!

If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Drieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

Night and day
Every way
Oh Jezebel!
Jezebel

Jezebel!
