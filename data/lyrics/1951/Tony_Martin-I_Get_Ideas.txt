When we are dancing and your dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true
The lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you
