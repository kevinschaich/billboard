Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?
Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached the climax, climax

I've fallen somehow, feet off the ground
Love is the cloud, that keeps raining down
Where are you now when I need you around?
I'm on my knees but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?
Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached the climax, climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess, what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at all?

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?
Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached the climax, climax

You say, it's better if we love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now when I need you around?
I'm on my knees but it seems we're going

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?
Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached the climax, climax
