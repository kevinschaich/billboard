Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican bar
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King’s College in March
She says that I’m her favorite cause she admires the art

Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She’s well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect
So smile, and pack your bags real good baby
'Cause you’ll be gone for a while, while while

Girl tell me how you feel
What your fantasy?
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my señorita
We ain’t gotta rush
Just take it slow

You’ll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I had you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I’m to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I’m feeling single baby

I could use a feature
Swagger like Ceaser, I’ll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Colosseum
I’ll be da Vinci if you’ll be my Mona Lisa
So smile, and pack your bags real good baby
'Cause you’ll be gone for a while

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

Well I been feeling singular
How about let’s make it plural?
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that’s where we’ll go
We’ll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall’s with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo

Private reservations, glasses full of merlot
A rose, a burgundy, travel like turbo
Brush up on your Español
We’ll Barcelona bounce
So smile, and pack your bags real good baby
'Cause you’ll be gone for a while

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa

La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa
