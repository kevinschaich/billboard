I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal

Your love bows down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal

Your love bows down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now

And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
