Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy are you afraid of the dark? (dark)
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start? (start)

And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part
Aaaaahhhhh

And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
Well the sound is the key to my heart (heart)

We run, yes, we run the night (ni, ni, night)
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run (run)
We run, yes, we run the night (the night)

Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!


From the bottom of the map (Miami)
To the land down under (Australia)
You feel my draft, see my vision, and hear my hunger
As my money gets older, their's get younger
They sell their soul, but the devil knows
I have no number

I'm global, baby
Hey!
Official baby
Hey!

Go, go, baby
Hey!
Oh, oh, baby!
Hey!

No, no, baby!
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, baby!
Hey!

Now jiggle it, baby
Let me tickle it, baby

I know I'm lost
It's gonna be hard to save me
I'm sorry that's how Dade County raised me
Ya heard me right
We run the night

Now fuck you pay me


We run, yes, we run the night (ni, ni, night)
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run (run)
We run, yes, we run the night (the night)

Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!

Feel it like a rush, rush, rush
Brushing past me all over my skin (skin)
I can't get enough, nough, nough
'Cause the beat keep pulling me in

Takin' me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been
Aaaaahhhhh

Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day then do it again (again)


We run, yes, we run the night (ni, ni, night)
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em whoop
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run (run)
We run, yes, we run the night (the night)

Run 'em like run 'em run 'em...whoop!
