Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
 

Yes I can, doubt that I leave, I'm running with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in a bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip
Like You the One Drinking What God Sip.com?
Now I gotta work with your tongue
How many Rolling Stones you want?

Yeah I got a brand new spirit,
Speak it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, US to Taiwan

I hope you say that, I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a wrap, ASAP
 

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
 

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second, imma strike oil
Diamond, platinum, no more for you

Gotta drill a land, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den

That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can't hold me down
A hundred miles feelin' from the picture smile

Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates,
Take a genius to understand me
 

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
 

Good feelin', good feelin'
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it


Gotta love the life that we livin'
Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'
 
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
