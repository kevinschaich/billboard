Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it’s going good

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song

I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
Cause you’ll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song

I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song

I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

I don’t want this night to end

No, I don’t want this night to end
