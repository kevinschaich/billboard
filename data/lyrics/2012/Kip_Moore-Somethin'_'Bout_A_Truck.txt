Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night
Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

And there's somethin' 'bout a girl, in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a man
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' 'bout a kiss, that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

Somethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 a.m.

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
