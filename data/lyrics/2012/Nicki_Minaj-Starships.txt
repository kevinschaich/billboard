(RedOne...)
Oh, let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get a wave
They say, what they gonna say?

Have a drink, clink
Found the Bud Lite
Bad bitches {1} like me 
Is hard to come by

The Patrón, on
Let's go get it on
The zone, own
Yes I'm in the zone

Is it two, three? 
Leave a good tip
I'mma blow off my money 
And don't give two shits

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more
Till I can't stand

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...

(We're higher than a motherfucker){2}
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying 
My rent this month
I owe that

But fuck who you want {3}
And fuck who you like
Dance all ya life 
There's no end in sight
Twinkle twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear 
You say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money 
'Cause today pay day

And if you're a G
You a G-G-G
My name is Onika
You can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...

(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...

(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
