You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
Talking loud
Not saying much
Criticize
But all your bullets ricochet
Shoot me down
But I get up

I'm bulletproof
Nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet
You take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town
Haunted love
Raise your voice
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud
Not saying much

I'm bulletproof
Nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet
You take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium

Stone heart
Machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone heart
Loves bulletproof glass

You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium

You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
