It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were...


It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, cause you've been waiting on me since
I said that I was hitting the club

Somthing coming up on me, 
and I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on

She might come and find me
And then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song


It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping


It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
"What is he doing?" oh "what is he doing?"

Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me like imma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
Ooo oh my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin' and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing

Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song


It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping


And you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya,
Too many thirsty girls up in this club 

For me to leave here with one of them that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
iPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
And you yawning
But I been drinking all night and I feel like performing
Wit you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser, don't want nothing less
'Cause I'm sure you're the best, you're the one

So I let you, that's how you show me love
And when we finished you like "Damn babe, you woke me up."
I love the way you put it down like it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's comin' up (ha ha ha ha ha)


It's 5 o'clock in the morning

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping
It's 5 o'clock in the morning!
