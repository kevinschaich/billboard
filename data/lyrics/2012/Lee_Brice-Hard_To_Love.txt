I am insensitive I have a tendency 
To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust, 
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me?

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love

You say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me. 
Good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball 
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus 
I wish that I could be more like you.

I'm hard to love, hard to love, 
I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love

You say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me. 
Good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances 
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted, 
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, 
Oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love

And you say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me. 
Good 
Good

You love me good
