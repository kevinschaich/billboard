I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Ooh (yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say "Never say never..."
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
