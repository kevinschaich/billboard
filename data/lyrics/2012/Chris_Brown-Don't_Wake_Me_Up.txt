Dearly beloved
If this love only exists in my dreams
Don't wake me up

Too much light in this window
Don't wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar
Inside my cup

If I wake and you're here still
Give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming
About your lips

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

Don't wake me up!
Don't wake me up!

Don't wake me up!
Yeaheah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

So much life in the city
You won't believe
Been awake for some days now
No time to sleep

If your heart is a pillow
This love's the bed
Tell me what is the music
Inside my head

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

Don't wake me up!
Don't wake me up!

Don't wake me up!
Yeaheah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep, no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep, no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

Don't wake me up!
Don't wake me up!

Don't wake me up!
Yeaheah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me
