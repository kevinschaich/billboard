Hey, boy, you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way

Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shit, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Trying to rock them ugly jeans, jeans, jeans

You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo-hoo-hoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shit, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Ooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first, oh-oh, oh-oh

We used to be, but now there's a separation
Between you and me
Baby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more
Dated her in front your place so you can see it all

I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell you're upset, because it ain't you

Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back?
We can just be friends, don't try to sting all over again

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shit, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Ooh, I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back
Ooh, I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back
