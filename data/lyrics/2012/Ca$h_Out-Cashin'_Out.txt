You know we smokin’ on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?

36 O’s so I’m ridin’ ‘round with that nina (I’m ridin’ ‘round with that nina)
Ridin’ with a hoe named Keisha, smokin’ on Keisha (You know we smokin’ on Keisha)
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you hoe?" (Hey can I meet you hoe?)
She fly high, high in the sky, hoe I can’t see you (Well I can’t see you)

Got a condo on my wrist - girl, I’m cashin’ out (I’m cashin’ out)
Got a condo around my neck - girl, I’m cashin’ out (I’m cashin’ out)
36 O’s so I’m ridin’ ‘round with that nina

I got Versace all on my back, these hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back, cause they know I’m movin’ that pack
These Louies all in my face, fo’-fifth stay up on my waist
Plus it ain’t on me for nothin’, so please don’t make me catch a case

Cause bitch I’m ‘bout it, me walkin’ ‘round with no check on me
Psssh - yeah I doubt it!
Your girl ain’t finna leave with me? Psssh - yeah I doubt it!
And I’m like, what the hell they talkin’ ‘bout?
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know I’m cashin’ out (cool)

Okay I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they comin’ by flocks in
Birds comin’ by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton

Play with my money, I’m poppin’
No actin’, but it’s a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain’t losing
Don’t act like yo’ hoe ain’t choosin’

I’m blowed up, yeah I’m the bomb, ridin’ round blowin’ on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms, top flo’ suite chillin’ at The Palms
We want the whole loaf leave y’all the crumbs, ‘til then I’m runnin’ my check up
And it’s fuck a Bugatti; I’m callin’ my jet up (cool)

Yeah - it’s big pimpin’ over here - chuuch
Time to cop the Maybach already had the ‘vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumpin’ out the kitchen

And I’m on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice, just like you playin’ hockey
And in the booth, I beat the beat up
Call me Rocky, yeah I’m cocky (cool)
