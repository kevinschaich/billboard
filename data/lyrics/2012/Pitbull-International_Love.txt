Went from Mr. 305 (Dade County)
To Mr. Worldwide (all around the world)
Now we're international,
So international, international,
So international

You can't catch me boy (can't catch me boy)
I'm overseas at about a 100 G's a show
Don't test me boy (don't test me boy)
'Cause I rap with the best fo' sho'

305 till the death of me
Cremate my body, let the ocean have what's left of me 
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby you're the referee

You put it down like New York City 
I never sleep 
Wild like Los Angeles 
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami 
I feel the heat 
Ohh girl miss international love (so international)
Ohh yeah miss international love 

Pitbull
I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere

Chris Brown
Everywhere?

Pitbull
Everywhere!

I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce 
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed

In Romania, she pulled me to the side and said, "Pit, you can have me and my sister."
In Lebanon, yeah the women da bomb
And in Greece, you guessed it, the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie there's nothing like Miami's heat.... dale!

Down in D.R., they looking for visas 
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean!
En Cuba la cosa esta dura 
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean

In Colombia women got everything done, 
But they're some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen 
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' booties and they thongs, blue, yellow, and green!

En L.A., tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua 
Besito para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah! 
Y en Miami tengo cualquiera!

There's not a place that your love don't affect me, baby 
So don't ever change 
I crossed the globe when I'm with you, baby 
Hey
Woah-oh 

Pitbull
