To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
'I'm On Fire' and 'Born To Run'
You looked at me and I was done
And we, we're just gettin' started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Sang 'Ooh, ooh'

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin', "Don't go"

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old Jeep, I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
There'd still be a spark

From back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born In The U.S.A'
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen?
Do you think about my old Jeep? Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen, Springsteen

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen
Whoa, Springsteen
