There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late

Now it's not like me 
To say the right thing
But you could've called 
To let me know
I checked your number twice
Don't understand it
So I went home

Well, I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe 
We could see a show
Never dreamed 
I'd have this feeling
Ah, but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late

Since then I've been running around 
Trying to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your house 
But got no answer
Jumped in my car
I went 'round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving

Oh, there must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
There must be some misunderstanding
Yes, there must be some kind of mistake

(There must be
There must be) 
Misunderstanding
(There must be
There must be) 
Misunderstanding
(Yes, there must be
There must be) 
Misunderstanding
(Yes, there must be
There must be) 
Misunderstanding
