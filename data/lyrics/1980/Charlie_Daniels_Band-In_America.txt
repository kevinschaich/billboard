Well the eagle's been flyin' slow
And the flag's been flyin' low
And a lot of people sayin' that America's fixin' to fall
Well speakin' just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that 
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?) 
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
( We damn sure fooled you )
Yeah, we're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again

From The Sound up in Long Island 
Out to San Francisco Bay 
And everything that's in between them is our own 
And we may have done a little bit 
Of fightin' amongst ourselves 
But you outside people best leave us alone 
'Cause we'll all stick together 
And you can take that to the bank 
That's the cowboys and the hippies 
And the rebels and the yanks 
You just go and lay your hand 
On a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan 
And I think you're gonna finally understand

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?) 
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
( We damn sure fooled you )
Yeah, we're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?) 
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
( We damn sure fooled you )
Yeah, we're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again
