One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down,
Oh!

One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

(BARITONE SAX SOLO)

One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
