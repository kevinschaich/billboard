If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

There's lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
But I never want to lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers

It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
Let me breathe the air

If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

It's kind of a special feeling
Out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool, cool, cool change

(Time for a cool change)
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
For a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Ooh, I know it's time for a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Time for a cool change)
It's time for a cool change
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
You know it's time for a cool change
