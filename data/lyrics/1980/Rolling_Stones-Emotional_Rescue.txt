Is there nothing I can say, nothing I can do
To change your mind, I'm so in love with you
You're too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you

Don't you know promises were never made to keep?
Just like the night, dissolve in sleep
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue

Yeah, the other night, crying
Crying
Yeah I'm like a child, I'm like a child, like a child, like a child

You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekingese
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue

Yeah, I was dreaming last night, baby
Crying like a child
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
You could be mine, you could be mine, you could be mine, all mine

Mmm, yes, you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armour
Coming to your emotional rescue
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
I will be your knight in shining armour
Riding across the desert
On a fine Arab charger
