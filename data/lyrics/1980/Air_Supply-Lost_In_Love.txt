I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And you don't care for much but I'm not letting go 
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy, you'll want to carry on (Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy, you'll want to carry on (Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

(Instrumental)

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy, you'll want to carry on
(Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

Now I'm lost (Lost in love and I don't know much)
Lost in love ('Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch)
Lost in love (But I'm back on my feet and eager to be)
Lost in love (What you wanted)

Now I'm lost (Lost in love and I don't know much)
I'm lost in love ('Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch)
Oh, I'm lost in love (But I'm back on my feet and eager to be)
Lost in love (What you wanted)

Lost in love and I don't know much
(Fade)
