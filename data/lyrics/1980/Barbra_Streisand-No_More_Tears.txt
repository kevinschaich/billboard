It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears 
After all these years

No sunshine 
No moonlight 
No stardust 
No sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed 
I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be 
Like every other man
Our love, our love

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it

If you've had your fill 
Gt the check pay the bill 
You can do it

Tell him to just get out

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye 
And simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, 
I can't go on 
No more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, 
I want him out 
That door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right 
When it's over

(It's over)
If the feeling is gone 
Don't think twice 
Just move on 
Get it over

(Over, over)

Tell him to just get out, 
Say it clearly, 
Spell it out
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, 
I can't go on 
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, 
I want him out 
That door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

I've always dreamed 
To find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be 
Like every other man
Our love 
(I had no choice from the start)
Our love 
(I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love 
(Tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, 
I can't go on 
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, 
I want him out 
That door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

No more tears 
(No more tears)
No more tears 
(No more tears)
No more tears 
(No more tears)
No more tears 
(No more tears)
Enough is enough 
Is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough
I've had it 
you've had it 
He's had it, 
We've had is

I always dreamed 
I find the perfect lover,

But he turned out to be 
like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on 
I can't go on 
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out 
I want him out 
That door now

Goodbye mister 
Goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining 
It's pouring
There's nothing left 
For us here
And we won't waist 
Another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough 
Is enough is enough!
