Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?

Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?

Why don't you ask him what's going on?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

Don't say that you love me
Just tell me that you want me
Tusk

Don't say that you love me
Don't tell me that you
