When the night has come
And our land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me, 
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, to stand by me

And if the sky  we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should fall to the sea
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me, 
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand by me

Darlin', stand by me, 
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand by me

Darlin', stand by me, 
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand, stand by me...
