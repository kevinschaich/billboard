Oh I could hide 'neath the wings of the blue bird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise wipe the sleep out of our eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings.

CHORUS:
Cheer up sleepy Jean Oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen.

I once thought of you as a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be.
Oh when our good times started then
Not a dollar one to spend 
But how much baby do we really need
