Yeah

(Sunrise) There's a new sun a-risin'
(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(Stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(Shine the light) Need you close enough to guide me
(For all my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

Well, make a wish, baby
Well, and I will make it come true
Make a list, baby
Of the things I'll do for you

Ain't no risk, now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew

(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
(Love flows) Gettin' better as we're older
(All I know) All I want to do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me

(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(For better) For me, there's nothin' better
You're biggest part of me

Well, make a wish, baby (make a wish)
Well, and I will make it come true
Make a list, baby (make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you

Ain't no risk, now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew

Oh

More than an easy feelin'
She brings joy to me
How can I tell you
What it means to me?

Flow like a lazy river
For an eternity
I've finally found someone
Who believes in me (believes in me)
And I'll never leave (now I've found all I need)

Oh, not to doubt now
Mmm, make life grand

Well, make a wish, baby (make a wish)
Well, and I will make it come true
Make a list, baby (make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you

Ain't no risk, now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew, yeah yeah yeah

(Beside me) Need your lovin' here beside me
(To guide me) Keep it close enough to guide me
(Inside of me) From the fears that are inside of me
You're the biggest part of me

(Forever) Got a feeling that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(Forever) From now until forever
You're the biggest part of me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me, mmm

You changed my life
You made it right
And I'll be a servant to you
For the rest of my life

You're the biggest part of me
Ahh
