Who's goin' to ride that chrome three wheeler?
Who's goin' to make that first mistake?
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers
All the way to Fire Lake?

Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah
Joe's run off to Fire Lake?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake

Who wants to brave those bronzed beauties
Lyin' in the sun
With their long soft hair falling
Flying as they run
Ah they smile so shy and they flirt so well
And they lay me down so fast
They look up and say
Oh lord, am I really here at last?

Who wants to play those eights and aces?
Who wants a raise, who needs a stake?
Who wants to take that long-shot gamble
And head out for Fire Lake?

Head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Hey, head out
Who wants to go to Firelake
Head out, head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Out to Fire Lake
All right! Who wants to do it?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?

Who wants to do it?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Who wants to do it now?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Hey, who wants to head out, head out?
