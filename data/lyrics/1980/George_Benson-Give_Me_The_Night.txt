Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive

Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance

It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others 
On a ride through paradise

And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?

Just give me the night
Give me the night

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others 
On a ride through paradise

And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?

And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high

Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
