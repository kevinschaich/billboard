I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot 
I used to stay out 'til the break of day 
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it 
I just couldn't carry on that way 
Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true 
Didn't know I was so lonely, 'til I found you 

You can go the distance 
We'll find out in the long run 
(In the long run) 
We can handle some resistance 
If our love is a strong one 
(Is a strong one) 
People talkin' about us 
They got nothin' else to do 
When it all comes down 
We will still come through 
In the long run 
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run 

You know I don't understand 
Why you don't treat yourself better 
Do the crazy things that you do 
'Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you 
Did you do it for love? 
Did you do it for money? 
Did you do it for spite? 
Did you think you had to, honey? 

Who is gonna make it? 
We'll find out in the long run 
(In the long run) 
I know we can take it 
If our love is a strong one 
(Is a strong one) 
Well, we're scared, but we ain't shakin' 
Kinda bent, but we ain't breakin' 

In the long run 
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run
Yeah, yeah 
In the long run 
Ooh, ah, yeah
In the long run

Gonna find out
Ooh, fi-fi-fi-find out
Long, long, long, long
Long, long, long
Ooh, long, long, long, baby
Run, run, baby
Long, long, long, long
Ooh, yeah, yeah
