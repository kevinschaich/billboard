Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart, I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
