Somebody's gonna hurt someone 
Before the night is through 
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody 
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance 
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

Some people like to stay out late 
Some folks can't hold out that long 
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long 
Some time before the sun comes up 
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright 
So turn out the light, and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Heartache baby

Somebody's gonna hurt someone
(Somebody) 
Before the night is through 
Somebody's gonna come undone 
There's nothin' we can do 
(Everybody) 
Everybody wants to touch somebody 
If it takes all night 
Everybody wants to take a little chance 
To make it come out right 

There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know 
Let's go

We can beat around the bushes
we can get down to the bone 
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way, there's gonna be
A heartache tonight, a heartache tonight 
Oh, I know
There'll be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight I know, whoo hoo
Break my heart
