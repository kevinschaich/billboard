We walked to the sea
Just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air
Hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand

I said, love's easier when it's far away
We sat and watched the distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line
Where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I 
Are like strangers, a wide ways apart 
As we drift on through time

He said, it's harder now, we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
