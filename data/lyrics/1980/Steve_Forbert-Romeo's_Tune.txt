Meet me in the middle of the day 
Let me hear you say everything's okay 
Bring me southern kisses from your room 

Meet me in the middle of the night 
Let me hear you say everything's alright 
Let me smell the moon in your perfume 

Oh, gods and years will rise and fall 
And there's always something more 
It's lost in talk, I waste my time 
And it's all been said before 
While further down
Behind the masquerade the tears are there 
I don't ask for all that much
I just want someone to care…
That's right now 

Meet me in the middle of the day 
Let me hear you say everything's okay 
Come on out beneath the shining sun 

Meet me in the middle of the night 
Let me hear you say everything's alright 
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run 
Oh yeah

Oh yeah, yeah, yes
Oh yeah 

It's king and queen and we must go down now
Beyond the chandelier 
Where I won't have to speak my mind
And you won't have to hear 
Shreds of news and afterthoughts
And complicated scenes 
We'll weather down behind the light
And fade like magazines…
I…I love is alright now

Meet me in the middle of the day 
Let me hear you say everything's okay 
Bring me southern kisses from your room 

Hey, hey, meet me in the middle of the night 
Let me hear you say everything's alright 
Let me smell the moon in your perfume 

Oh now, meet me in the middle of the day 
Let me hear you say everything's okay 
Let me see you smiling back at me 

Hey, meet me in the middle of the night 
Let me hear you say everything's alright 
Hold me tight and love and loving's free 
Aw…right

O…kay
