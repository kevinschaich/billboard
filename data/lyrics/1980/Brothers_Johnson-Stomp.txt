Steppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel alright

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
'Till the morning light

Runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall

So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel alright

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
'Till the morning light

Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel alright

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
'Till the morning light

Stomp!

Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it
