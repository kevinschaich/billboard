Look at us, baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart 
Aren't we the same two people
Who lived through years in the dark?
Ah-ah

Every time I try to walk away 
Something makes me turn around and stay 
And I can't tell you why 

When we get crazy, it just ain't right (Try to keep you head, little girl) 
Girl, I get lonely, too 
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight (Don't get caught in your little world) 
'Cause I love you 

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
