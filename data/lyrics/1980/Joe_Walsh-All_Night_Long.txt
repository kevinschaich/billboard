We get up early and we work all day 
We put our time in 'cause we like to stay up 
All night long 

We keep on grinnin' till the weekend comes 
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum 
All night long, all night long 

Start in the morning and get the job done 
Take care of bus'ness and we have some fun 
All night long, all night long 

We like a long neck and a good old song 
Turn it up and then we sing along 
Sing along 
We're all stayin' up all night long 

All night long 
All night long 
All night long 
All night long
