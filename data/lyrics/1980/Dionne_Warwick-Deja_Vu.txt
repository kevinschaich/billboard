This is insane 
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love 
Like a love I used to know
Long ago
How can it be
We're a different space in time
Come to me
Feel Like I'm home in a place I used to know 
Long Ago

Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew 
Is it you
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you 
Déjà Vu

This is devine
I been waiting for so long
Filling time
Looking for you 
That's worth more than you could know
Long Ago
Come to me now
We dont have to dream of love 
We know how
Somewhere before its as if I loved you so
So long ago

Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew 
Is it you
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you 
Déjà Vu

Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew 
Is it you
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you 
Déjà Vu
