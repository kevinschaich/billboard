Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Oohoohooh oooh

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching, though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

"It's okay", he smiles and says
Though this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head
But if you watch very close you'll see it all

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Now, tell me, have you heard about the lonesome loser?
