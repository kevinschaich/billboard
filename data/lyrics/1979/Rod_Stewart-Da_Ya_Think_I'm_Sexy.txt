Surely, sugar, hmm

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all her questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so
Tell me so, baby"

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
"Come on, honey, let's spend the night together"
"Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother"
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey, tell me so"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know"
Ooh

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
"Relax, baby, now we're all alone"
Ow

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, "I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee"
"Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie"

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so"
Ooh

Sugar

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
Hmm
If you really want me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, j-just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so
Mm-hmm
Just reach out and tell me so
