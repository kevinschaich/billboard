Time, you found time enough to love
And I found love enough to hold you
So tonight, I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you, lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

Come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling alive
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile when you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling alive
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
