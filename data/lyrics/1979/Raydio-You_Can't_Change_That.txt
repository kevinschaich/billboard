Honey, I'll always love you
I promise I'll always love you
'Cause I think the whole world of you
And you can't change that, no, no

There's nothing you can do or say
I thought about this for many a day
And my mind's made up to feel this way
And you can't change that

'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

Now you can try if you want to, woo

You can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
No, you can't change that, no, no

You can change the color of your hair
And you can change the clothes you wear
But you'll never change the way I care
No, you can't change that

'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You're the one I love)
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

You're the one I love, girl
And you can try if you want to
Try me, baby, wooh

No, you can't change that
You're the one I love
You can try but
You can't change that
You're the one

You can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
No, you can't change that

'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You're the one I love)
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
(I need you, baby)

You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You may change a dollar bill)
You're the only one I need
(But let me tell you one thing)
And you can't change that
(You won't change the way I feel)

(You're the only one I love)
(And you can't change that)
I say my heart tells me how I feel
(You're the only one I need)
(And you can't change that)
It lets me know
It lets me know my love is real

(You're the only one I love)
No, you can't change that
You can't change my love girl
You're the only one I love
I need you, I love
I love, I need you
