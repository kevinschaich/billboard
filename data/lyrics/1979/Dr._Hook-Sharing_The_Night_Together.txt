You're looking kinda lonely girl
Would you like someone new to talk to
Ah-yeah, alright
I'm feeling kinda lonely too
If you don't mind can I sit down here beside you
Ah-yeah, alright

If I seem to come on too strong
I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
If you're as lonely as I am and if you'd mind
Sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night

We could bring in the morning girl
If you want to go that far
And if tomorrow find us together
Right here the way we are would you mind
Sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night

Would you like to dance with me and hold me
You know I want to be holding you
Ah-yeah, alright
'Cause I like feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes that you're liking it
I'm liking it too
Ah-yeah, alright

Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go
Where we can be alone together
And turn the lights down low
And start sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night together
Oh-yeah, sharing the night together
Sharing the night together
Sharing the night together
Sharing the night together
Sharing the night together
