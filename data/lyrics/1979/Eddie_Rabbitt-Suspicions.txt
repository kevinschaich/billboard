I'm so glad that I met you, baby
And I'm so proud when we walk down the street
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do
But I get this feelin' that I'm losing you

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Suspicions, I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions, I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Ooh, suspicions

When I'm with you, I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
And that look you get in your eyes when we love
It makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions, I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Suspicions, even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Ooh suspicions, even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
