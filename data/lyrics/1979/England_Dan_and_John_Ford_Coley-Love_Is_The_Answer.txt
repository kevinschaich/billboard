Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore
To shore to shore

If there's a shortcut
I'd have found it
But there is no
Easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday, we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard

It's such a lonely
Lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by, tell me
Is it worth just another try

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Tell me, are we alive
Or just a dying planet
(What are the chances)
Ask the man in your heart
For the answer

And when you feel afraid
(Love one another)
When you've lost your way
(Love one another)

And when you're all alone
(Love one another)
And when you're far from home
(Love one another)

And when you're down and out
(Love one another)
And when your hopes run out
(Love one another)

And when you need a friend
(Love one another)
And when you're near the end
(Love, we got to love
We got to love one another)

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
(Shine, shine, shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer....
