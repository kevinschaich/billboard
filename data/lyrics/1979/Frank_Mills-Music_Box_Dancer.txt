You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown
You reach for the shelf and cradle it down
The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove
Only that you need to see a statue that moves
A tutu of satin, bordered with lace
Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face
Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose
Eternally destined to remain on her toes

Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy
Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy
She's perched on her stand, and never will part
A final gaze upon her, now the music will start

You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because
You've been here before, so give one final pause
To dream of the future, to reflect on the past
Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last

The room fills with music, such a cute song
Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs
Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow
Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show

Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe
She could step off her box if she wanted to leave
So easy it is, twirl around with such grace
Staying in her circle, she remains in one place

Such a brief moment, a small time to spend
The dancing will slow soon, the music will end
In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair
How can we breathe life, how can we share
The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs
We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms
We sit on our shelves where objects reside
We don't allow the music to get right inside

Music Box Dancer's now completely alone
No winder or no listener, because nobody's home
How long before someone will re-wind the spring?
The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing
