Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time, make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

A long time ago I had a lady to love
She made me think of things I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song, it was there all the time

So, lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor making me want you somehow
Oh, lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinking that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do

Look around, come to me
I have no answers, but know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

So, lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor making me want you somehow
Oh, lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinking that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do
Don't be thinking that I don't want you, lady, I do
