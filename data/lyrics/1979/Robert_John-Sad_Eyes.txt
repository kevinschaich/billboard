Looks like it's over, you knew I couldn't stay
She's coming home today
We had a good thing, I'll miss your sweet love
Why must you look at me that way, it's over

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Try to remember the magic that we shared
In time your broken heart will mend
I never used you, you knew I really cared
I hate to sit and defend, but it's over

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry (cry, cry, cry)
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other way
