Extra! extra!
I'm in love
I gotta thank my luck stars above
Hurry, hurry don't be late
I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
The main event
You're my every thought
Baby
You're my own attraction
You must be heaven's saint
You give me so much satisfaction
You're the one
You make life worth fighting for
You're the one-ah!
And there is nobody quite like you
Honey, you're the one...

You're my everything


And it's my conclusion
There is no sweeter scent
When you have found the right solution
Cause you're the one
You make life worth fighting for
You're the one
And there is nobody quite like you
You're my number one
You're my number one

Extra! extra!
I'm in love
I gotta thank my luck stars above
Hurry, hurry don't be late
I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
The main event
We're the main event!
