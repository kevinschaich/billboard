Oh mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my runnin', and I'm so far from my home
Oh mama, I can hear you a'cryin, you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

(Yeah!)

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade, who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man

Oh mama, I been years on the lam,
And had high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get 'em dead or alive!"
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead

Dear mama, I can hear you a-cryin'
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade, who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

Oh mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me

Retrieved for a bounty
Never more to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man

And I don't wanna go
Oh, no

Hey, woo
Wuh!
Oh, no, no, oh, no
