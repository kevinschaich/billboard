He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate what had yet to be created

Once in her life she musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all
Keeps sending him

Somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be (If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing (Fool's got the power)
And nothing at all (Oh, now)
What a fool believes (I believe she's never gone away)
He sees (Oh)
No wise man has the power (To reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be (Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (Better than nothing)
And nothing at all
