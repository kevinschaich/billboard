Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh

I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you

You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
I ain't no vision, I am the man who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
But let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
I ain't no vision, I am the man who

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
