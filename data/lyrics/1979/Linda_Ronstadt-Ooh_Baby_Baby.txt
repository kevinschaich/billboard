I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in the game I lost you
What a price to pay

I'm crying
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby

Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes, too

I'm crying
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby

I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

'Cause I'll be here
Someday I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here

Ooh, I'm crying
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh
