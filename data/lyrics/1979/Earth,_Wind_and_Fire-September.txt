Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say, do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September?
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba du-da, ba du-da, ba du-da, ba-du
Ba du-da, ba-du, ba du-da, ba-du
Ba du-da, ba-du, ba du-da, yeah

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart
To see you, only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love
We shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today

Ba de ya, say, do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September?
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

And we say, ba de ya, say, do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September?
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days

Now our bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember every cloudy day, yow

And we say ba de ya, say, do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September?
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

And we say ba de ya, say, do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September?
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days

Ba de ya, de ya, de oh
Ba de ya, de ya, de oh
Ba de ya, de ya, de oh, de ay

Ba de ya, de ya, de oh
Ba de ya, de ya, de oh
Ba de ya, de ya, de oh, de ay
