It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All 'round the day was going down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go drifting into 

Time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Well, I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on are things that don't last
Well, it's just now and then my line gets cast into these 

Time passages
There's something back there that you left behind
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel that there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well, the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something and the music's loud
A girl comes towards you you once used to know
You reach out your hand but you're all alone, in those

Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
