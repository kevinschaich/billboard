Makin' it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Makin' it

I'm solid gold
I've got the goods
They stand when I walk
Through the neighborhoods

I'm makin' it
I've got the chance
I'm takin' it
No more, no more
Fakin' it
This time in life
I'm makin' it (oh-oh-oh)
Makin' it

Hello uptown
Goodbye poverty
The top of the ladder is waiting for me
I'm makin' it
I've got the chance
I'm takin' it
No more, no more
Fakin' it
This time in life
I'm makin' it (oh-oh-oh)

Listen everyone here
This coming year's gonna be my year
I'm as bad as they come
Number two to no one
I've got looks, I've got brains
And I'm breakin' these chains
Make some room now dig what you see
Success is mine
I've got the key
I'm makin' it
