(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland)

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts
Of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand
To a woman who has laid too many bets

The mirror stares you in the face and says
"Baby, uh uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers, though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland)

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland

(I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland)

(All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland, wonderland)

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)

(I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland)

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)

(Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, wonderland
Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, wonderland
Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm)

(All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland, wonderland)

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)

(I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland)

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)
