Hey, yeah
Here come the jesters, one-two-three
It's all part of my fantasy
I love the music and I love to see the crowd
Dancing in the aisles and singing out loud, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Here come the dancers, one by one
Your mama's calling but you're having fun
You find you're dancing on a number nine cloud
Put your hands together, now, and sing it out loud

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy, yeah
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, yeah

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream
Yeah

Put out the spotlights, one and all
And let the feeling get down to your soul
The music's so loud, you can hear the sound
Reaching for the sky, churning up the ground

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, oh yeah
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, yeah

Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
