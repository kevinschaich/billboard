Have you seen her, so fine and pretty
Moving with a style and ease?
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree

Ooh (baby baby)
Won't you turn your head my way?
Ooh (baby baby)
Now come on, take a chance, you're old enough to

Dance the night away
Woah, come on baby, dance the night away

A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go
She's on fire 'cause dancing gets her higher
Than anything else she knows

Ooh (baby baby)
Won't you turn your head my way?
Ooh (baby baby)
Well don't skip romance, 'cause you're old enough to

Dance the night away
Woah, come on baby, dance the night away

Oh, oh yeah

(Dance the night away) Hey hey, yeah
(Dance, dance, dance the night away) Ah, come on baby
(Dance the night away) Hey hey, yeah
(Dance, dance, dance the night away) Uh, come on baby, baby

(Dance the night away) Ooh ooh, yeah
(Dance, dance, dance the night away) Ah, ha ow
