You don't bring me flowers 
You don't sing me love songs 

You hardly talk to me anymore 
When I come through the door at the end of the day... 

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me 
Used to hate to leave me 
Now after loving me late at night 

When it's good for you, babe 
And you're feeling all right 

When you just roll over and turn out the light... 
And you don't bring me flowers anymore 

It used to be so natural 

It used to be...

To talk about forever 

Mmm... 

But used-to-bes don't count anymore 
They just lay on the floor 
Till we sweep them away 

And baby I remember all the things you taught me 

I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry 

Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye 
You don't bring me flowers any more... 

Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye... 

'Cause you don't say you need me; 

You don't sing me love songs

You don't bring me flowers anymore...
