Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about begin true
And all the trouble we've been through

Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans we had
For fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action, I want to live!

Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too

Ohoho, I
Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Please don't talk about love tonight
Your sweet talking won't make it right
Love and lies just bring me down
When you've got women all over town

You can love them all and when you're through
Maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you
I got to go where the people dance
I want some action, I want to live!

Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too

Ohoho, I
Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah

I love the nightlife
I've got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yeah
