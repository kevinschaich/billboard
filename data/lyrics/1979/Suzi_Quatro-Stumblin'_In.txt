Our love is alive and so we begin 
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table,stumblin'in 
Our love is a flame burnin' within 
Now and then fire light will catch us, stumblin'in 

Wherever you go, whatever you do 
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are followin' you 

I've fallen for you, whatever you do 
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew 
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you 

You were so young, ah, but I was so free 

I may have been young but baby, that's not what I wanted to be 

Well you were the one 

Oh why was it me? 

'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I'd never seen 
Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me 

Ah, stumblin' in, mmm, stumblin' in 
Now and then fire light will catch us, stumblin'in 

Oh, stumblin' in, I'm stumblin' in 
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin'in
