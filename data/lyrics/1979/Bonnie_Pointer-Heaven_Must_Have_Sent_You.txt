I've cried through many endless nights
Just holding my pillow tight
Then you came into my lonely days
With your tender love and sweet ways
Now I don't know where you come from baby
Don't know where you been now baby
Heaven must have sent you into my arms

Now in the morning when I awake
There's a smile upon my face
You touch my heart with gladness
Wiped away all of my sadness
Oh so long I've needed love right near me
A soft voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you baby into my life

Ooh it's heaven in your arms
It's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay

Wanna thank you for the joy youve brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close
When I needed you the most
Now I dont know much about you baby
But I know I cant live without you
Heaven must have sent you honey
To love only me

It's heaven in your arms
It's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
