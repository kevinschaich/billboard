You got me rollin' like a wheel on the road
Turnin' round and round, nowhere to go
I've got to find out if you're feeling it, too
It's hard to tell, so here's what I do
And everytime I want more
I'll take you out on the floor

I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long
I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long

The days and nights are moving by me and you
You're such a crazy love, you tear me in two
I spend my time moving to dreams and a phase
It's a crazy love, you can see it in my face
And everytime I want more
I'll take you out on the floor

I was made for dancin'


All-all-all, all night long (yeah)
I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long

I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long
I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long

Ah-hah, dancin'
I was made for dancin', ah-hah
I was made for dancin', dancin', dancin'

I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long (yeah)
I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long
Oh, I was made for dancin'
All-all-all, all night long (yeah)
