I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had
Has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I want you bad, hey, hey

I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such
A way of learning so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I need your touch, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

I sat here staring at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb
Right through the telephone line
And give you what you want so you will still be mine, hey, hey

I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce
On precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together, 'cause I missed your kiss, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby

Oh, lover, lover, this is solid love
And you're exactly what I'm dreaming of
All through the day
And all through the night
I'll give you all the love I have with all my might, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Ooh, listen baby
I won't ever make you cry
I won't let one day go by
Without holding you
Without kissing you
Without loving you
Reunited

You're my everything
Only you know how to free
All the love there is in me
I wanna let you know
I won't let you go
I wanna let you know
I won't let you go
Reunited

Ooh, feels so good

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey
