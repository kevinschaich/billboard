It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa

It's not in the words that you told me, girl
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always, love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time, whoa, whoa, whoa
