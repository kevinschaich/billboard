I did not know what you were about
Something called "love" made me want to find out
Did not think you could ever care
But I'm outta control 'cause you're takin' me there

I couldn't believe our love would last
It's comin' on stronger, comin' on so much faster

Get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love

Get used to it, don' t let me down
You pulled me in, so don't turn me around
You didn't hesitate and told me just how you feel
There ain't no mistake, this time it's for real

I didn't believe our love would last
It's comin' on stronger, comin' on so much faster

Get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love, please

I'll be around you
Because I'm crazy about you
I'll be around you, baby
You know I can't live without you
I'll be around ya, baby
Because I'm hungry for your love

So you better get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love, please

Ya better get used to
All my love, baby
Ya better get used...
To our love
