Take me home
Take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home
Take me home
With you is where I want to be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just makin' love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above
Take me home (take me home)
Take me home (take me home)
Oh can't you see I want you near
(Can't you see I want you?)
Take me home (take me home)
Take me home (take me home)
Ooh baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere
Your place or mine
Just a one-night affair
Would be so fine

I'm in heaven (heaven)
Seems like heaven (heaven)
So much in heaven (heaven)

(Take me home)
(Take me home)

One night with you
Lyin' here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy
Ooh I'm in heaven (heaven)
Seems like heaven (heaven)
So much in heaven (heaven)

Take me home (take me home)
Take me home (take me home)
Ooh I want to feel you close to me
(I want to feel you close)
Take me home (take me home)
(Take me home) ooh with you
Is where I want to be
Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just makin' love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Well I'm in heaven (heaven)
Seems like heaven (heaven)
(Take me, take me home, home with you)
C'mon and take me, ooh baby
Baby take me home
(Take me, take me home, home with you)
You'll be lyin' next to me,
Baby it'd be ecstasy

(Take me, take me home, home with you)
Ah can't you see I want you near
Baby, baby let's get out of here
(Take me, take me home, home with you)
