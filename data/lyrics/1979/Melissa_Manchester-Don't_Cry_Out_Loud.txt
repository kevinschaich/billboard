Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about her, 'cause you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter
But Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that was me
I told her

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost made it

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all
