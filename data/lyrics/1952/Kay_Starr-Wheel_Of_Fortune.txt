The wheel of fortune
Goes spinning around
Will the arrow point my way?
Will this be my day?

Oh, wheel of fortune
Please don't pass me by
Let me know the magic of
A kiss and a sigh

While the wheel is spining, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning fortune or fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame

Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you'll ever smile on me
Please let it be now

While the wheel is spining, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning fortune or even fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame

Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you ever smile on me
Please let it be now
