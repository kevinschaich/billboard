Down in old Kentucky
Where horseshoes are lucky
There's a village smithy standin' under a chestnut tree
Hear the hammer knockin'
See the hammer rockin'
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes
See the hot sparks a-flyin'
Like Fourth of July-in'
He's even got the horses cloppin', pop! down the avenue
Folks love the rhythm
The clang-bangin' rhythm
You'll get a lot o' kicks out of the Blacksmith Blues
