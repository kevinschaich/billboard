(Ooh-wah)
(Ooh-wah)
(Ooh-wah)

If your sweetheart send a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry...
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real?
But it's only false emotions that you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found
Behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Well, now, remember sunshine can be found
Behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go right on baby and cry

(Go on and cry)
