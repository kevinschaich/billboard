I walked down the street like a good girl should
He followed me down the street like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I walked to my house like a good girl should
He followed me to my house like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be 
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I never saw the boy before, so nothing could be sillier
At closer range his face was strange but his manner was familar

So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

So I walked to my door like a good girl should
He stopped at my door like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

He asked me for a good night kiss
I said it's still good day
I would have told him more except
His lips got in the way

So I talked to my ma like a good girl should
And ma talked to pa like I knew she would
And they all agreed on the married life for me
A guy is a guy wherever ever he may be

So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should 
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be 
So now youv'e heard the story of what someone did to me.

That's what he did to me
