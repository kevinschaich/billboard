I know, you don't love me no more
(I know)
No more, no, no more
(No more)
And I don't want to be hurt anymore
(No more)
Anymore
(No more)

Yeah, yeah, I have loved so hard
Everything I did was no 
If I can't love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all

I know, you don't want me no more
(I know)
No more, no, no more
(No more)
And it has to be someone else loving you more
(No more)
Loving you more
(No more)

Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round

I know, no more, no more
No more, no more
I know, you don't want me no more
(I know)
No more, no, no more
(No more)

And it has to be someone else loving you more
(No more)
Loving you more
(No more)

Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round
I know, I know
(I know, I know)
