Johnny Angel
You're an angel to me

Johnny Angel
How I love him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist

Johnny Angel
How I want him
How I tingle when he passes by
Everytime he says hello my heart begins to fly

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

Other fellas
Call me out for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel
'Cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

Other fellas
Call me out for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel
'Cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be
