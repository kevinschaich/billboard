(One, two)
(One, two, three, four)

Hey, baby, won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Well, let's dance, well, let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Okay, wail now
Oh, yeah

Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well, let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that this is the night

Well, let's dance, well, let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well, let's dance

Well, let's dance
Well, let's dance
Well, let's dance
