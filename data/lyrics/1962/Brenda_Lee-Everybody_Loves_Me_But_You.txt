Why did I listen
To my friends
When they told me
What to do
Yes
I still
Have my friends
But I don't
Have you

And like true friends
They still come around
And say, "I'm sorry
You're blue"
Whoa, oh
Everybody loves me
But you

My friends don't know what they've done
And, well
They wouldn't matter anyhow
I can't tell them they were wrong
Cause I'm afraid they'll leave me, too
Now, it's funny
But more than ever
I need them now

I still ask
My friends
What to do
But it seems
They don't know
How to bring
How to bring you back
They say
What made him go?

Yes, like true friends
They still come around
And say, "I'm sorry
You're blue"
Whoa, oh
Everybody loves me
But you
