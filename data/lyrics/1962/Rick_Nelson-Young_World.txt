It's a young world
When you're in love, you're in a young world
So take my hand and let me show you
Just how true young love can be
And whoa-uh-oh

It's a young world
And if you'll tell me you're my one girl
You'll make my whole life worth livin'
Just by givin' your love to me

All of the world is a treasure
When you have someone to care
Promise me your love for-e-ver
We'll have the whole world to sh-a-are

And it's a young world
When you're in love, you' re in a young world
If you believe what I've told you
Let me hold you, say you love me

All of the world is a treasure
When you have someone to care
Promise me your love for-e-ver
We'll have the whole world to sh-a-are

And it's a young world
When you're in love, you' re in a young world
If you believe what I've told you
Let me hold you, say you love me

It's a young world, whoa-oh-oh
It's a young world, whoa-oh-oh
(Fade)
It's a young world, ooh-ahh-ooh-ooh (young world, young world)
