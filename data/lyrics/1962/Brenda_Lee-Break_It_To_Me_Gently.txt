Break it to me gently
Let me down the easy way
Make me feel that you still love me
If it's just, if it's just for one more day

Break it to me gently
So my tears, my tears won't fall too fast
If you must go, then go slowly
Let me love you 'til the last

The love we shared, for oh so long
Is such a big part of me
If you must take your love away
Take it gradually

Oh, oh, break it, break it to me gently
Give me time, oh give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer
'Cause I'll never never love again
'Cause I'll never love again
