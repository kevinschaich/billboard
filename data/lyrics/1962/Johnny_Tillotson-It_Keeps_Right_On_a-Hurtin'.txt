I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

It keeps right on a-hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

They say a man should never cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free 
But you forgot your memory
And keeps right on a-hurtin' since your gone

It keeps right on a-hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
