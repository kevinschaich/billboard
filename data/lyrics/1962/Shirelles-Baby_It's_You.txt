Sha la la la la la la la-a
Sha la la la la la la la-a
Sha la la la la la la la-a

Sha la la la la
It's not the way you smile
That touched my heart –
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss
That tears me apart!
Uh, oh, oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you –
What can I do?
I can't help myself, 'cause baby, it's you –
Baby, it's you!
(Sha la la la la)
You should hear, what they say about you
(Cheat cheat)
(Sha la la la la)
They say, they say
You never never, never, ever been true!
Uh oh

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way!
What can I do, and it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody –
But, baby, it's you!
(Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you!
(Sha la la la la la la)

Uh, oh, oh, many, many, nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you –
What can I do?
Can't help myself, 'cause baby, it's you –
Baby, it's you!
Don't leave me all alone –
Come on home!
