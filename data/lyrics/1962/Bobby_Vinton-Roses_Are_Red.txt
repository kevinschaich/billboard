(Roses are red, my love)
(Doo doo da doo)

A long, long time ago 
On graduation day 
You handed me your book 
I signed this way: 

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you." (as sweet as you)

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter, dear
And I wrote back to you:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But luck may God bless you." (may God bless you)

Is that your little girl? 
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."
(Roses are red)
