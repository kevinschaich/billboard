And when I told her 
I didn't love her anymore 
She cried (she cried) 
And when I told her 
Her kisses were not like before 
She cried (she cried) 
I thought that our romance was over and done 
But to her it had just begun 

And when I told her 
Another girl had caught my eye 
She cried (she cried) 
And when I kissed her 
A kiss that only meant goodbye 
She cried (she cried) 

(sha-la-la-la sha-la-la) 

And when I told her 
I didn't love her anymore 
She cried (she cried)
