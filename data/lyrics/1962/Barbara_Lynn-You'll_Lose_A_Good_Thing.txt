If you should lose me,oh yeah,you'll lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah,you'll lose a good thing

You know I love you,do anything for you
Just don't mistreat me,and I'll be good to you

Cause if you should lose me, oh yeah, you'll lose a good thing

I'm givin you one more chance,for you to do right
If you'll only straighten up,we'll have a good life

Cause if you should lose me,oh yeah,you'll lose a good thing

This is my last time,not asking any more
If you don't do right,I'm gonna march outa that door

And if you don't believe me, just try it daddy
And you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing....fades
