(Party lights, I see the party lights)
Wo
(They're red and blue and green)
Lights
(Everybody in the crowd's there)
Mama, I wanna go, go, go, go, go, go, yeah, yeah

Well, mama dear, tell me, do you hear?
We're partying tonight
I tell you, I can't sleep because across the street
Wo, oh, I see the party lights

I see the lights, I see the party lights
They're red and blue and green
Everybody in the crowd's there
But you won't let me make a scene

Well, mama dear
Look here, oh, dear
There goes Mary Lou
I see Tommy and Joe

Oh, oh, and Betty Sue
Oh, oh, and there goes my boyfriend too
I see the lights

I see the lights, I see the party lights
They're red and blue and green
Everybody in the crowd's there
But you won't let me make a scene

Listen to the party, mama

Well, mama dear
Look here, oh, dear
I'm feeling, oh, so blue
They're doin' the twist, the fish

The mashed potatoes too
I fear, I'm lookin' at you
I see the lights

I see the lights, I see the party lights
They're red and blue and green
Everybody in the crowd's there
But you won't let me make a scene

They're doin' the fish, they're doin' the twist
The watusi, the mashed potatoes
I see the lights, I see the lights
They're doin' the bop, I wanna go
