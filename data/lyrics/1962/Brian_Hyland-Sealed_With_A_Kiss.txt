Though we've got to say good-bye for the summer 
Darling, I promise you this 
I'll send you all my love 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer 
But I'll fill the emptiness 
I'll send you all my dreams 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

I'll see you in the sunlight 
I'll hear your voice everywhere 
I'll run to tenderly hold you 
But, Darlin' you won't be there 

I don't wanna say good-bye for the summer 
Knowing the love we'll miss 
So let us make a pledge 
To meet in September 
And seal it with a kiss 

Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer 
But I'll fill the emptiness 
I'll send you all my love 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

Sealed with a kiss 
Sealed with a kiss 
Sealed with a kiss
