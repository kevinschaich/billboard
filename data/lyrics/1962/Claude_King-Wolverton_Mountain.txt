They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey and Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he might take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain it's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter from the one who loves her so
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...
And I don't care about Clifron Clovers I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love I don't care about Clifron Clovers
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain and I'll get the one I love
