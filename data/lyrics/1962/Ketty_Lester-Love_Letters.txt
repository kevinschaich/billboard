Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darlin', then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
