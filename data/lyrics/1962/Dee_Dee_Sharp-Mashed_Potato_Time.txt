It's the latest, it's the greatest, 
Mashed Potato, ya, ya ,ya 

A Mashed Potato started long time ago 
With a guy named Sloppy Joe, 
You'll find this dance is so cool to do, 
Come on baby, gonna teach it to you. 

Mashed Potato, feel it in your feet now, 
Mashed Potato, come on get the beat now, 
Baby, come on honey, come on baby. 

And then they dance it through and through, 
They look for records they can do it to, 
They got a dance was outta sight, 
Doin' the lion sleeps tonight. 

Mashed Potato, Ya a weem o wep a weem o wep, 
Mashed Potato, ya, ya, ya, ya, 
It's the latest, aw baby, 
It's the greatest, come on honey, 
Ya, ya ya, ya, 

Now everybody is doin' fine, 
They dance alone or in a big boss line, 
And they discovered it's the most, man, 
The day they did it to Please Mr. Postman. 

Mashed Potato, wait a minute, wait a minute, 
Mashed Potato, deliver de letter, 
It's the latest, come on baby, 
It's the greatest, oh honey, 
Ya, ya, ya, ya. 

Well they got with more and more, 
Ya ought to see 'em around the floor, 
The Mashed Potato ?????????? 
They even do it to Dear Lady Twist. 

Mashed Potato, ya, ya, ya, ya, 
It's the latest, come on baby, 
It's the greatest, oh honey, 
Mashed potato, feel the groovy beat now.
