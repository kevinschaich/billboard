It was a moonlit night in Old Mexico.
I walked alone between some old adobe haciendas.
Suddenly, I heard the plaintive cry of a young Mexican girl:

La la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la
la la la la.

You better come home Speedy Gonzales, away from tannery row.
Stop all of your drinking with that floosie named Flo!
Come on home to your adobe and slap some mud on the wall!
The roof is leaking like a strainer. There's loads of roaches in the
hall.
(La la la la)

Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
how come you leave me all alone?

"He, Rosita, I have to go shopping downtown for my mother,
she needs some Tortillias and Chilli Pepper!"

La, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
la la.

Your doggie's gonna have a puppy, and we're running out of Coke.
no enchiladas in the icebox, and the television's broke.
I saw some lipstick on your sweatshirt, I smell some perfume in your
ear.
Well, if you're gonna keep on messin', don't bring your business back
a-here.
(La la la la)

Mmm, Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
how come you leave me all alone?

"He, Rosita, come quick!
Down at the cantina, they're giving green stamps with Tequila!"

La, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la
la la la la la.
