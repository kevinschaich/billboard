We're having a party
Dancing to the music 
Played by the DJ
On the radio
The cokes are in the icebox
The popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby, we're out here on the floor

So listen, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging
Sally's doing that twist now
If you take request, I....
I got a few for you
Play that song called Soul Twist
Play that one called I Know
Don't forget the Mashed Potatoes
No other songs will do

Let me tell you Mr., Mr. DJ
Why don't you keep those records playing
Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Having a party--yeah
Everybody's swinging--oh we're
Dancing to the music--yeah
On the radio--oh we're
Having a party--man
Everybody's swinging--yeah
Dancing to the music--yeah
On the radio--say it one more time

We're having a party--yeah
Everybody's swinging--oh we're
Dancing to the music--yeah 
On the radio
