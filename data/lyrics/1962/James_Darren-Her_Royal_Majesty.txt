Ladies and gentlemen
Presenting, Her Royal Majesty

There she goes, Her Royal Majesty
She's the queen that broke my heart
I put her up, upon a throne
And now she's left me all alone and cryin'

There she goes, Her Royal Majesty
Wearin' my heart for a crown
Oh, let me tell you, everybody
How she made a fool of me, Her Royal Majesty

Now, would ya believe she acted oh, so sweet
Until she just had me kneelin' at her feet?
She got me to eat right from her little hand
Her smallest wish was my command

Well, there she goes, Her Royal Majesty
Marching off with someone new
Well, I believed she really loved me but now at last I see
I was the King Of Fools to Her Royal Majesty

Well, I believed she really loved me but now at last I see
I was the King Of Fools to Her Royal, Her Royal Majesty
