(C'mon baby, I need gravy)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gravy tonight

I know you danced the mash potato fine
But that don't show me that you're really mine
What's your dancin', without romancin'?
So put that somethin' extra on the line

Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon an' treat me right
Gimme (gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight

I dig this twistin' but I want some more
There's somethin' missin' while we're on the floor
C'mon baby, I want some gravy
A little kissin's what I'm waiting for

Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon an' kiss me right
Gimme (gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight

Yeah!

Now when the mash potato's finally through
There's lots of groovy, gravy things to do
Lot's of lovin', kiss n' huggin'
I wanna ride that gravy train with you

Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon an' hold me tight
Gimme (gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight

Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon an' treat me right
Gimme (gravy)

Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight
Gimme
