I'm gonna knock on your door
Ring on your bell
Tap on your window, too
If you don't come out tonight, when the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do

I'm gonna knock on your door (how-how)
Call out your name (how-how)
Wake up the town, you'll see (how-how)
I'm gonna hoo-hoot and howl like the lovesick owl
Until you say you're gonna come out with me 

Hey little girl (how-how) this ain't no time to sleep
Let's count kisses 'stead of countin' sheep
How (how-how) how can I hold ya near

With you up there and me down here?

I'm gonna knock on your door
Ring on your bell, tap on your window, too
If you don't come out tonight when the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do

Hey little girl (hey little girl)
This ain't no time to sleep (how-how)
Let's count kisses 'stead of countin' sheep (how-how)
How (how-how) how can I hold ya near (how-how)
With you up there and me down here?

I'm gonna knock on your door
Ring on your bell, tap on your window, too
If you don't come out tonight, when the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do

I'm gonna knock and ring and tap
And knock and ring and tap
And knock and ring and tap
And knock and ring until you do.
