Don't go 
(Please stay)
Don't go 
(Please stay)

If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my ar-arms
Would you walk  out the door like you did once before? 
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay? 

Don't go 
(Please stay)
Don't go

If I called out your name like a prayer in the night
Would you leave me alone with my tears? 
Knowing i-i, I love you so-o, would you still turn and go? 
Or would this time be different in some wa-a-ay? 

Don't go 
(Please stay)
(Please stay)

You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved – by your kiss

If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my ar-arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before? 
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay? 

(Don't go)
(Please stay)
(Don't go)
(Please stay)
(Don't go)
(Please sta-ay-ay-ay-ay) 
(Ay-ay-ay-ay) 
(Ay-ay-ay-ay)
