I'm a travelin' man
Made a lot of stops all over the world 
And in every port I own the heart 
Of at least one lovely girl 

I've a pretty Seniorita waiting for me 
Down in old Mexico 
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see 
My cute little Eskimo 

Oh, my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town 
Makes my heart start to yearn 
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong 
Waits for my return 

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea 
I remember the night 
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki 
And I held you oh so tight 

Oh, my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town 
Makes my heart start to yearn 
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong 
Waits for my return 

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea 
I remember the night 
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki 
And I held you oh so tight 

Oh, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Oh, I'm a travelin' man
