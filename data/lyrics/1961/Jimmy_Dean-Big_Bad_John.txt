Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245 
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip
To Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all you just said "hi" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fella to the Promised Land, Big John

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast 
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, "There's a light up above."
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
And now there's only one left down there to save
Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line
For Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit 
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
"At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man...
Big John"
