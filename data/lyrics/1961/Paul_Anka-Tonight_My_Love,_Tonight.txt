La-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la 
Let me hold you in my arms 
Let me thrill to all your charms 
Hold me, hold me, hold me tight 
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight 
Love me, love me, love me so 
And never, never let me go 
Hold me, hold me, hold me right 
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight 
Forever, I will love you forever 
The mandolins are playin' 
The moon above is sayin' 
It's love, it's love, I know, I know it's love 
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me warm 
Make me feel like I've been born 


Hold me, hold me, hold me right 
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight 
Forever, I will love you forever, yes I will 
The mandolins are playin' 
The moon above is sayin' 
It's love, it's love, I know, I know it's love 
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me warm 
Make me feel like I've been born 
Hold me, hold me, hold me right 
Tonight, tonight my love, tonight
