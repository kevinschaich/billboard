Come on come on and do the fly with me
Hey come on everybody and do the fly with me
Well if you don't know how to do it
Just watch and see

You've gotta shake your hands all around and around the sky
And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and guys are getting the  there're gonna fly

Oh you pretty little girl come and fly away with me
Hey pretty little girl fly away with me
We're gonna fly to the sky
But you mustn't fly away from me

And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and guys are getting the  there're gonna fly
Go ahead baby

Come on come on and do the fly with me
Hey come on everybody and do the fly with me
Well if you don't know how to do it
