Though you say we are through
I'll always love you
And you can depend on me

Though someone that you met
Has made you forget
Honey, you know, you can count on me

Well, I wish, I wish you success
And loads, loads of happiness
But, baby, I've gotta confess
I'll be lonely

If you ever, ah, if you ever need a friend
I'll be yours until the end
And you can depend on me

I wish you success
And loads of happiness
But, darling, I've gotta confess
I'm gonna be loney

If you ever, ah, if you ever need a friend
I'll be yours right by your side ah until the end
And you can depend on me
