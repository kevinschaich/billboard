If my friends should ask for me
Here at home is where I'll be
There's no one I care to see
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart

Now the heartache has begun
There's a job that must be done
I'll have no time for havin' fun
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart

Aw, leave me alone
And let me cry, cry, cry
There are tears that must be cried
Till there's no more tears inside

Let me take a count of ten
Then, I'll bounce right back again
Let me be alone till then
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
