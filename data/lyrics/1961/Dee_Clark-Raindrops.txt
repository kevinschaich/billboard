Oh, Raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

Since my love has left me
I'm so all alone
I would bring her back to me
But I don't know where she's gone
I don't know where she's gone.

There must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes 
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry.

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops 
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

Oh, there must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes.
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry.

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

It keeps on fallin'
Fallin' from my eyes
Wooo, it keeps on fallin' from my eyes
