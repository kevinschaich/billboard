Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold.

Don't pity me, 'cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed it might happen to you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love, kiss me 
One time then go love, I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me.

Sweet, sweet, sweet, love will I want you to be
As happy as I when you love me
I'll never forget you your sweet memory it's all over now Don't worry bout me.

When one heart tells one heart, one heart goodbye
One heart is free, one heart will cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet
It's all right don't worry 'bout me...
