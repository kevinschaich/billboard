Stars hang suspended
Above a floating yellow moon
Two hearts were blended
While angels sang a lover's tune.

And so we kissed,
Not knowing if our hearts would pay the price
But heaven welcomed us to paradise
Blessing our love.
Then came the sunrise,
Fading the moon and stars from sight

Recalling always
Our wonderland by night.
