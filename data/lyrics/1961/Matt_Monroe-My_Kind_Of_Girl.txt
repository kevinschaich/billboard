She walks like an angel walks 
She talks like an angel talks 
And her hair has a kind of curl 
To my mind shes my kind of girl .

Shes wise like an angel's wise 
With eyes like an angel's eyes 
And her smile's like a kind of pearl 
To my mind shes my kind of girl 

CHORUS 
Pretty little face -
That face just knocks me off-a my feet 
Pretty little feet -
Shes really sweet enough to eat. 

She looks like an angel looks 
She even cooks like an angel cooks 
And my mind's in a kind of whirl 
To my mind she's my kind of girl 

REPEAT CHORUS 
She looks like an angel looks 
She even cooks like an angel cooks 
And my mind's in a kind of whirl 
To my mind she's my kind of girl 

And my heart's kinda filled with joy 
Because she told me I'm her kind of boy
