A-one, a-two, a-one two three four
No more books and studies
And I can stay out late with my buddies
I can do the things that I want to do
'Cause all my exams are through
I can root for the Yankees from the bleachers
And don't have to worry 'bout teachers
I'm so glad that school is out
I could sing and shout!

(School is out) Everybody's gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody's gonna jump and run
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out)
I just got time to take my girl out on a date
School is out at last
And I'm so glad I passed
So everybody come and go with me!
We're gonna have a night with Daddy Go Daddy!

That's great!
Let's celebrate!
With a little bit of soul now!
Oh yeah!
The party's here!

(School is out) Everybody's gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody's gonna jump and run
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out)
I just got time to take my girl out on a date
School is out at last
And I'm so glad I passed
So everybody come and go with me!
We're gonna have a night with Daddy Go Daddy!

(School is out) Everybody's gonna have some fun
