Come on everybody, clap your hands
Oh, you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song, it won't take long
We're gonna do the twist and it goes like this

Come on, let's twist again like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again, twistin' time is here

Go round and around and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so, and then

Twist again like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again, like we did last year
Twist, yo!

Who's that flyin' up there?
Is it a bird? (No!)
Is it a plane? (No!)
Is it the twister? (Yeah!)

Yeah, twist again like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Come on, let's twist again, twistin' time is here

Go round and around and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so, and then

Come on, let's twist again like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
