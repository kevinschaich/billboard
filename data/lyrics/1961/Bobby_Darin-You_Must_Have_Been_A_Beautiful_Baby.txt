Oh … you know, you know, you know, you know … 

You must a been a beautiful baby
You must a been a beautiful child 
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove those other childs wild!

Oh yeah … oh yeah … oh yeah … 
An' when it came to winnin' blue ribbons
Well ... I bet you taught the other kids how 
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I bet you took the cutest bow! 

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
'cause baby won't you look at you now. 

Oh yeah ... oh yeah ... oh yeah ... 

You must a have been a beautiful baby
You must a have been a beautiful child
When you were only startin'

To go to kindergarten
I know you drove the other childs wild.
An' I wasn't even there.

An' when you came to winnin' blue ribbons
Hey … I know you taught those other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I know you made the cutest bow! 

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
‘cause baby won't you look at you now. 
Oh, I mean … I mean … oh, beautiful …
Oh, beautiful ...
Oh, beautiful ...

Oh, beautiful ...
Oh, beautiful ...
Oh, beautiful ...

Aah, I know you're beautiful … too beautiful for words ...
