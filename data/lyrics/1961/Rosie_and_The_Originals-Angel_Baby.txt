It's just like heaven
Bein' here with you
Your like an Angel
To good to be true

But after all
I love you, I do 
Angel Baby
My Angel Baby

When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby

Ooo oo I love you
OO oo I do
No one could love you
Like, I do

Wooo Whooo whooWhoo WHOO
WooWhoooWhoo

Please never leave me
Blue and alone
If you ever go
I'm sure you'll come back home

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My Angel baby

It's like heaven
Bein' with you dear
I could never stay
Away without you near

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby

Wooohoo I love you
Whooohoo I do
No one could love you
Like I do

Woooo whooo whooo
Woooooo whoo whoo
