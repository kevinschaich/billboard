I couldn't sleep at all last night
Just a-thinkin' of you
Baby, things weren't right

Well I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

I kicked the blankets on the floor
Turned my pillow upside down
I never, never did before

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

Jumped out of bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite

Rolled up the shade
Turned out the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night

The clock downstairs was strikin' four
Couldn't get you of my mind
I heard the milkman at the door

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

Jumped outta bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite

Rolled up the shade
Turned off the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night

The clock downstairs was strikin' four
Couldn't get you of my mind 
I heard the milkman at the door

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

I was tossin' and turnin' 
Turnin' and Tossin' 
A tossin' and turnin' all day

I was tossin' and turnin' 
Turnin' and tossin' 
I was tossin' and turnin' all night
