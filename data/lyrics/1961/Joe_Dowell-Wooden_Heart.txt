Can't you see, I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

There are no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good, treat me like you know you should
'Cause I'm not made of wood and I don't have a wooden heart
