Peace up!
A town down!


Yeah, yeah, okay! Usher.
Lil John!


Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.


Let's go.


I'm in the club with my homies
Tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
'Cause you know how it feels

I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow


Watch out! 
Watch out!


She was sayin' "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the flooor
She said "Baby let's go"
When I told her I said.

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea
To take her with me, (with me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)

Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a 1-to-10
She's a certified 20
But that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me

The way she getting low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah


Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And Rowl!  These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow

Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say


Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah


Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Usher got the voice to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go
