Oh, oh
Lalalalala

I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree
In LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things
It don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down, on my own
And no

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop askin'
Askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better 
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me (me)
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around

You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl 
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter 
If you're rich or poor
Out or in
Doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better

What makes you think
That I would forget about ya
Think about it
Who comes to see ya
Every Saturday and Monday
I was on that receiver

It's me (me)
Your girl (girl)
Your life (life)
Your world (world)
My family and friends
They just don't understand
They say, I should leave you alone
But I say, that they all should just leave us alone

Don't you get it
I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop askin'
Askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better 
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around

You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl 
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter 
If you're rich or poor
Out or in
Doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better

(musical interlude)

You should've known better 
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around

You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl 
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter 
If you're rich or poor
Out or in
Doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better
