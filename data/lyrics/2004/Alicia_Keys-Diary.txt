Ohoho

It's like that, yeah

Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No-one has to know what you are feeling
No-one but me and you, ohoho

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary, heyey

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away, mmm-mmm
Oooh, baby if there's anything that you fear, anything
Come forth and call 4894608 and I'll be here, here

I won't tell your secrets (Shhh)
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets (Shhh)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Yeaheaheah
Mmm-mmm
Yeaheaheaheah
You know what?

And only we know what talked about, baby boy
Don't know how you can be driven me so crazy, boy
Baby, when your in town why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy, ohoho

I won't tell your secrets (I want, I want,I want)
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (Your)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Everybody say ohohoho (Ohohoho)
Everybody say ohohoho (Ohohoho)
Everybody say ohohoho (Ohohoho)
Say it, ohohoho (Ohohoho)

Lemme hear you say, I won't tell (I won't tell)
I won't tell (I won't tell)
I won't tell (I won't tell) your secrets, your secrets
When you're down, oho
