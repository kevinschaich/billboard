Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore,
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to poppin we do shit for fun
You aint got one nigga you betta run
Now I'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin my blunt sayin she aint havin fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she aint got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish 
Homeboy trippin cause I'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P.

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
