(I'm sorry)
(I'm Sorry)

It's like I missed a shot,
It's like I dropped the ball. 
(Damn I'm Sorry)
It's like I'm on stage, 
And I forgot the words. 
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like building a new house, 
With no roof and no doors.
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like trying to propose, 
And I ain't got the ring. 
(Oooh damn I'm sorry)

But girl I've apologized 
A million times before.
(I'll apologize a million more)
So here it comes again 
For all the wrong I've done. 
(So get ready babe)
Here's One million one. 

(Chorus)
Girl this is my sorry for, 2004.
And I aint gonna mess up no more, this year.
I'm 'a take this one chance,
And make it real clear.
I'm sorry for May 
And I'm sorry for June (For real) 
And I'm sorry for July (I am) 
In case I dont tell you. 
August, September, October, November 'til your December. 
I'm Sorry. 
(I'm sorry 2004)

Its like stayin' out at night, 
Had way too much to drink.
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like you change your hair,
And I don't say a thing.
(Damn I'm sorry)
It's like we're fallin' fast asleep, 
With no kiss, and before we hit. 
(Damn, I'm sorry)
And It's like I forgot your gift,
On 02 14 03. 
(Damn, So sorry!)

But girl I've apologized 
a million times before.
(I'll apologize a million more)
So here it comes again 
for all the wrong I've done. 
(so get ready babe)
Here's One million one. 

(Chorus)
Girl this is my sorry for, 2004.
And I aint gonna mess up no more, this year.
I'm 'a take this one chance,
(I'm 'a take my time)
and make it real clear.
I'm sorry for May 
and I'm sorry for June (for real) 
and I'm sorry for July (i am) 
in case I dont tell you. 
August, September, October, November 'till your December. 
I'm Sorry. 
(I'm sorry 2004)

(Hook)
I'm sorry for the way that I did you
I'm sorry for the thought and how I hurt you girl
I'm sorry on the weekends, sorry on the weekdays
sorry for the things I did, Sorry for the things i said
sorry for the lies
sorry for the time
That I didn't get you what you want, 
That I didn't get you what you like.
What can I do to tell you that I'm sorry babe.
(sorry, sorry)

Oooooooooooooohhhhhhh! (echo)
Wooooooooh!
All them strip clubs,
all them hot tubs.
I'm gone give them up,
'cause I dont want to lose your love

(Chorus)
Girl this is my sorry for, 2004.
And I aint gonna mess up no more, this year.
I'm 'a take this one chance,
and make it real clear.
I'm sorry for May 
and I'm sorry for June (for real) 
and I'm sorry for July (i am) 
in case I dont tell you. 
August, September, October, November 'till your December. 
I'm Sorry. 
(I'm sorry 2004)

(Starts Fading)
Girl this is my sorry for, 2004.
