Poli Paul
Spencow, baby

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talking, why not make him wait for you?
(If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you)

Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?

That's when you give it to him good

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

You’re getting bold, he’s growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
(You think it's time
And you’re thinking of leaving but give it time)

It's late at night, he's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair, let him know what's on
If you understand me y’all come on

(All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move) Move
(All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do) Show her what you got, daddy

(All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move) How to move
(All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do) Show her what what you wanna do

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing) (Yeah, uh, yeah, uh)
(I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

Baby girl, the way you pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thing
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my things

You sure know how to make a man say "Oh"
And how in the world can a man say "No"
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi Lime it up ‘till you fall

Line it up ‘till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin’, vomit it up
When they can find it up in the mall
Like most men, I like to catch up with a model
But I ain’t used to movin’ slow like ketchup in a bottle

The best things come to those who wait for it
But I’m-a be straight forward before it’s too late for it
But I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out and make me say "Oh"

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")

(Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta, pop ta, pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say "Oh")
