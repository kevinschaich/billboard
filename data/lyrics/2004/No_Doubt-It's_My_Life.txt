It's funny how I find myself in love with you
If I could buy my reasoning, I'd pay to lose
One half won't do
Oh, I've asked myself 
How much do you commit yourself?

Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew if I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose
I'd tell myself, what good do you do?
Convince myself

Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
Oh, it's my life
It never ends

I've asked myself 
How much do you commit yourself?
Oh, it's my life 
Don't you forget 
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

And it's my life
Don't you forget 
Caught in the crowd
It never ends
(It never ends)

Oh, it's my life
(Oh, it's my life)
Don't you forget
(Don't you forget)

Caught in the crowd
(Caught in the crowd)
It never ends
(It never ends)
