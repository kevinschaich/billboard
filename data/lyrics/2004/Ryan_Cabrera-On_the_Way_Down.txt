Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself, going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cuz

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

I was so afraid of going under
But now, the weight of the world 
Feels like nothing, no nothing
(down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
(down, down, down)
You're all I needed
(down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted, all that I needed now

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you
