Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip,Game over 


Ah shit y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga with dreams of gettin' rich (But
you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field (football field)
You might fuck around and think I signed a football deal (But you
don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gat (But you don't hear me)
I make 'em bounce all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your hoe takin' off her clothes (But you don't
hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is when I usually drop it (But you don't hear
me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, niggaaaaa




Look, I'm a Christal nigger and you a red-winer
You just an opening act, but I'm the headliner (But you don't hear
me)
I'm 'bout to ship 3 mill' off top
You got your deal off your man, I got my deal off props (But you don't
hear me)
I'm connected like dub and Mach-10 with ice cubes in my watch

And dubs on the black Benz (But you don't hear me)
I'm getting' paid 'cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move all our work, we go bizirk (But
you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Mostly yall cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man (But you don't
hear me)
I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it 



The game over, 'cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over (But you don't
hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how you get fucked up (But you don't hear
me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit,nigger the streets was mine (But
you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that "Thug Life" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. "Ready to Die" shit
