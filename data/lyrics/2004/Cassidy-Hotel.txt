(Intro - R Kelly)
Ladies and gentlemen, you are listenin to the sounds of swizz beatz
We got cassidy in here. Kels! We in our throwbacks
This is for the ladies, w got room keys

(Chorus - R Kelly)
Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin'

(Cassidy/Swizz Beatz)
I'm staying in the ho-tel, not the mo-tel or the holidae inn (say what?)
If that girl don't participate, well then I'ma take her friend (say what)
Well if, mami is with it then, mami can give it then
Mami a rider, Im'a slide up beside her
I got a suite, you can creep on through
I know you tryin' to get your freak on too

I do it all for the (ladies)
Yeah I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies)
Keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on the (ladies)
Hot tub for my (ladies)
Pop bub for my (ladies)
I got love for my (ladies)

(Chorus - R Kelly)
Girl you wanna come to my hotel
baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin

(Cassidy/Swizz Beatz)
We're the new Car-tel, R-Kell with the kid Cassidy(say what)
Girl if you man start actin' up, ask for him or ask for me (say what?)
Cuz see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what will happen
we be under the covers, makin' love to each other
I got a double bed, one's to sleep on, other one's to get my freak on
It's all for the (ladies)
Yeah I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies)
Keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on the (ladies)
Hot tub for my (ladies)
pop bub for my (ladies)
I got love for my (ladies)

(Chorus - R Kelly)
Girl you wanna come to my hotel

I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin'

(Cassidy/Swizz Beatz)
We goin Chi-town steppin out, to the club lettin' out
and we go and sex it out, till we all checkin out
I got my chicks I'ma bring to the telly

(R Kelly)
It's alright (it's alright)
If you wanna come with me

And it's OK, if you wanna party night till day
I will do anything you say
Just come to my hotel

(Chorus - R Kelly)
Girl you wanna come to my hotel

And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holla at me
Cuz we're havin a after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
