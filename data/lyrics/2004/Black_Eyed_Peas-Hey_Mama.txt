Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shawty, I know you want to party

I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of Old, and a bigger bit of New
The true niggas know that the peas come thru
We never cease, we never die no we never decease
We multiply like we mathamatice
And then we drop bombs like we in the middle east
The bomb bombas, the base move dramas
Naw y'all knaw, who we are

Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And, lookin' hard without bodygaurds

Y'all come through 
Will.i.am
And still I stand, with still mic in hand
So come on mama, dance to the drama

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama

So shake your bum bumma, come on now mama

We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma

The beat bump bumpas all in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club got tha plump plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits we need to carry 9mm clips
Dont wanna squize trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
Lubaluba 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas
Naw y'all knaw, who we are
y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
How we rockin' it girl, without body guards

B.E.P., come and take heed, as we take the lead

So come on papa, dance to the drama
