He said, "I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout 
sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do"
And he said

"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying"
And he said, "Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'"

He said, "I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well, I, I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again 
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named 
Fumanchu,
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying"
And he said, "Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'"

Like, tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do 
with it
What did you do with it? 
What did I do with it? 
What would I do with it? 

Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named 
Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said, "Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'" 
Live like you were dyin' 
Live like you were dyin' 
Live like you were dyin' 
Live like you were dyin'
