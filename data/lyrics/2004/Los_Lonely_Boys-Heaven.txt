¡Vámonos!

Save me from this prison
Lord help me get away
'Cause only you can save me now
From this misery

I've been lost in my own place
And I'm getting weary
(How far is Heaven?)
And I know that I need to change
My ways of living
(How far is Heaven?)
Lord can you tell me?

I've been locked up way too long
In this crazy world
(How far is Heaven?)
And I just keep on praying Lord
And just keep on living
(How far is Heaven?)
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
(How far is Heaven?)
'Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah
(How far is Heaven?)
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?

Tú que estás en alto cielo
Échame tu bendición

'Cause I know there's a better place
Than this place I'm living
(How far is Heaven?)
And I just got to have some faith
And just keep on giving
(How far is Heaven?)
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
(How far is Heaven?)
I just got to know how far, yeah
(How far is Heaven?)
Yeah, Lord can you tell me?
(How far is Heaven?)
'Cause I just gotta know how far...
I just wanna know how far
