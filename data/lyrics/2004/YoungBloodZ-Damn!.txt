Cock back bust aim now I done got yo number
In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder

Where dem niggaz pimp hoes in fly suits and gators
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call
Just dial 1-800-430 slash ALCOHOL
And dawg I'm not the one that you really just wanna clown
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut 'em down
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool
In the cut 'bout slizzard somewhere that's how we do

Out of town hard heads get swiss cheesed up
And you gon' need more than stitches to patch that leak up
Chump like me up my mouth TB'd up
With the plush leather guts steady grippin' the butt
Oh you fo sho with it, then pull yo pistol
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it
Talkin' big boy shit
Me muggin' like a motherfucker my hand on my dick

Cuz at a grip we keep it jumpin' like it ain't nuttin' new
We started off with Shake Em Off so look potna oh guess who
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85
And hit you with that U-Way so don't be surprised
We buckin' blowin' chillin' and sippin' on something good
I'm peepin' out the scenery and wishin' a nigga would
In case it just might pop I'm 'bout ready to lock and load
To take you thru the South to show you how we throw dem bows
