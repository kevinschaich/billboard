Ciara:
My goodies, my goodies
My goodies not my goodies

Petey Pablo:
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is a few seconds or more
And it's a wrap
You can tell the lady to bring my lap
And I ain't coming back
So you can put the car right there
I'm the truth and I ain't got nothing to prove
And you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it

Barricades, I run right through 'em
Used to 'em
Throw all the dirt, you want I'm used to it
Still gonna have a pent up in a fabulous room
Bone her back, picking at a basket of fruit
(I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freaky Petey love u too
Ha, ha, you know how I do it?

Ciara:
You may look at me and think that
I'm just a young girl but I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm lookin' for
Sexy, independent
Down to spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on looking 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I ain't wit it so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

You may feel slick, tryna hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on looking 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Petey Pablo:
So damn hot but so young
You ain't got milk in your tongue
Slow down little one
You ain't got it all, hey shorty
You don't play the game

You may be bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beating the bag
I've been working at it ever since
I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet
But I'm getting better at it

Matter of fact
Let me tell it to you once more again
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't one chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam bam bam
(You think I'm payin' for it?)

Ciara:
You're insulating that, I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changing stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on looking 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on looking 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
