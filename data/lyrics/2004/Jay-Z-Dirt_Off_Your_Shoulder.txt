You're now tuned in to the motherfuckin' greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulders off nigga'
I got you, yeah

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy who told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls 
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga' cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder

Your homey Hove in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes-sir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But like, fifty-two cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga', go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder

Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful Bey-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, nigga's scared of that black
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it
As the best rapper alive nigga akse about me
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler homie
You a customer, crony
Got some, dirt on my shoulder, could you brush it off for me?

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga', go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Nigga's is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder

Now tuned into the Motherfuckin' greatest

Best rapper alive, best rapper alive
