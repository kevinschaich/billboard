'Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
And I can't keep picturing you with him 
And it hurts so bad, yeah 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
I replay it over and over again 
And I can't take it yeah I can't shake it 
Nooo 

I can't wait to see you 
Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes 
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes 
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time 
Being mad about the same things 

Over and over again 
About the same things 
Over and over again 
Ohh 

But I think she's leaving 
Ooh man she's leaving 
I don't know what else to do 
(I can't go on not loving you) 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
And I can't keep picturing you with him 
And it hurts so bad, yeah 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
I replay it over and over again yeah 
And I can't take it yeah I can't shake it 
Nooo 

I remember the day you left 
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me 
When you said that you would leave 
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything 

But I see clearly now 
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head 
Over and over again 
Playing my head 
Over and over again 

Ohh 
I think she's leaving 
Ooh man she's leaving 
I don't know what else to do 
(I can't go on not loving you) 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
And I can't keep picturing you with him 
And it hurts so bad, yeah 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
I replay it over and over again 
And I can't take it I can't shake it 
Nooo 

(Now that I've realized that I'm going down 
From all this pain you've put me through 
Every time I close my eyes I lock it down oh 
I can't go on not loving you) 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
And I can't keep picturing you with him 
And it hurts so bad, yeah 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
I replay it over and over again 
And I can't take it I can't shake it 
Nooo 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
And I can't keep picturing you with him 
And it hurts so bad, yeah 

Cause it's all in my head 
I think about it over and over again 
I replay it over and over again 
And I can't take it I can't shake it 
Nooo 

Over and over again 
Over and over again 
Cause it's all in my head
