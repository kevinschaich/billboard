Oh yea ah ah ah
Is ah big dancehall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Little
You know how it is,
You know how we go
You know

For the longest while we jamming in the party
And you wining in on me
Pushing everything up
Right back on top of me
(Tea, hey, ai)

But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you
Girl caress my body

You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on

Let me jam you
Girl wine
All around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on

If she think mad man nah go fight
Me done feed her with popcorn and sprite
Now she whar come fly way like kite

Ooh yea yea

Ooh yea yea yea
Ooh yea yea yea yea yea yea

One hand on the ground and
Bumper cock sky high
Wining hard on me
Got my Python
Hollerin' for mercy, yea hey 'ai
Then I whisper in her ear
So wine harder
And then she said to me
Boy just push that thing
Push it harder back on me

So, let me hold you
Girl caress my body

You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on

Let me jam you
Girl wine
