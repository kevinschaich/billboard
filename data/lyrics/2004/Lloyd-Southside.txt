Scarface
My southside, my getbak
My heartbreaks, my karmas
My set backs, my home town
My life time, my sun up
My sundown, my everything
My used to be, my has been
My love line, my blood line
Memories come flashin'
My neibougherhood, ma old g's
The young niggas behind me
The don't spread, the hussle hard
These bitches that remind me
Stay up all ma hussle hard
Cuz people love to see you fail
Hate to see you gettin green

Walkin far if i got mo booze
Yea your hats still to the back

Got a pocket full of crack
Lock it up and get a jacket
Ain't no commin back from now
You wrapped up on the party line
Out here we acceptin (?)
