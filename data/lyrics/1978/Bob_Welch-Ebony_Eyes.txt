Well, have you seen that girl in the corner
I'd like to take her out of her chains
'Cause if I had my way with you, baby
I would be changing your life today

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

She was the same as a hundred ladies
But when my eyes looked at her I learned
That she was keeping a secret fire
And if I got real close I'd burn

So it looked like I had to move slowly
Just like a cat at night in the trees
'Cause I was waiting for her to show me
That way that she liked her love to feel

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Your eyes got me dreaming 
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping 
That I'll be holding you close tonight
