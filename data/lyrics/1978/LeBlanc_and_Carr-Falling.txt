I think about winter when I was with her
And the snow was falling down
Warmed by the fire I love being by her
When there's no one else around

And I'm falling, whoa, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you

I think about summer my head was swimming
You wrote my name in the sand
We walked together hoping forever
Please don't let go of my hand

'Cause I'm falling, whoa, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you

The fall and the springtime were like in between time
You're here and then you're gone away
Whoa, I just wanted to stay
Won't you please, please stay
'Cause I'm falling, whoa, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you

In love with you
In love with you
