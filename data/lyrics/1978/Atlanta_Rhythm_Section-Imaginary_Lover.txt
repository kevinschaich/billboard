Imaginary lovers never turn you down 
When all the others turn you away, they're around
It's my private pleasure, midnight fantasy 
Someone to share my wildest dreams with me
Imaginary lover, you're mine anytime
Imaginary lovers, oh yeah

When ordinary lovers don't feel what you feel 
And real life situations lose their thrill
Imagination's unreal
Imaginary lover, imaginary lover
You're mine anytime

Imaginary lovers never disagree
They always care
They're always there when 
You need satisfaction guaranteed
Imaginary lover, imaginary lover
You're mine all the time
My imaginary lover
You're mine anytime
