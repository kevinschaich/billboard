Shame
Burning, you keep my whole body yearning
You got me so confused
It's a shame
Sometimes I think I'm going insane
But still I want to stay

Wrapped in your arms
I Is where I want to be
F want to be, want to be
Wrapped in your arms
That's my high, my high

Shame, ooh
My mother says you're playing a game
And what you do to me is a
Shame
Ooh, gonna love you just the same
Mama just don't understand
Wrapped in your arms
Is where I want to be
I want to be, want to be
Wrapped in your arms
That's my high, my high
I can't get enough, ooh baby
Enough of that magic touch
Love is in my heart
Tearing the rules apart
So, why should I be ashamed

Only love can be to blame
If we lose our love
It's a shame
Ooh, I wouldn't want to live with the pain
Gonna stay forever

Wrapped in your arms
Is where I want to be
I want to be, want to be
Wrapped in your arms
That's my high, my high
Only love can be to blame
If we lose our love
It's a shame
Ooh, I wouldn't want to live with the pain
Gonna stay forever
Oh, it's a shame
Shame (etc.)
