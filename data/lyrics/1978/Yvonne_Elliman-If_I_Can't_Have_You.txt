Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end and it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time if I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh

Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily, to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh

Oh, if I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh (no, nobody)
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh (I don't want nobody)

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh (nobody)
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh
If I can't have you
