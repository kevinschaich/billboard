Don't look back
A new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind
Where I get taken
The road is callin'
Today is the day

I can see
It took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
Oh, yes I will

I - finally see the dawn arrivin'
I - see beyond the road I'm drivin'

It's a bright horizon
And I'm awakin' now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin'
The clouds are breakin'
‘Cause I can't lose now
There's no game to play

I can tell
There's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong
Oh, yes I can

I - finally see the dawn arrivin'
I - see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Oo, far away and left behind
Left behind

Oh, the sun is shining
And I'm on that road

Don't look back
A new day is breakin'
Oh, it's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind
If I get taken
The road is callin'
Today is the day

I can see
It took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
Oh, yes I will

I - finally see the dawn arrivin'
I - see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Oh, far away and left behind

Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
