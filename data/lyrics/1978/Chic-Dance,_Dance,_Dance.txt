Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Just dancing to the beat
Feel the heat
I'm moving my feet

Heading towards the floor
Gotta get down
Get down some more

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you

Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa

Oooh, what a treat
Feels so sweet (Ah)
That body heat

When I'm dancing with my baby
Drives me crazy
Makes me hazy

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you

Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
