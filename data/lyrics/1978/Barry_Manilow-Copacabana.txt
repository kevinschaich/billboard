Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor
They worked from eight 'till four

They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa
They fell in love

(Copa, Copacabana)

His name was Rico, he wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancin' there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far, Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two

There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa
She lost her love

(Copa, Copacabana
(Copa, Copacabana
Copacabana!
Music and passion
Always in fashion)

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind

She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind!

At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa (Copa), Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa
Don't fall in love

(Copa) Don't fall in love (Copacabana)

(Copacabana, Copacabana
Copacabana, Copacabana)
