Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time on my side
I got it all
I heard that pride
Always comes before a fall
There's a rumour goin' 'round the town
That you don't want me around
I can't shake off my city blues
Everywhere I turn, I lose

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time is no healer
If you're not there
Lonely fever
Sad words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Love is like oxygen...
