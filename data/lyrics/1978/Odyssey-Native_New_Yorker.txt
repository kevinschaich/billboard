New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh

Runnin' pretty, New York City girl
25, 35, hello, baby
New York City girl

You grew up ridin' the subways, running with people
Up in Harlem, down on Broadway
You're no tramp, but you're no lady
Talkin' that street talk
You're the heart and soul of New York City

And love
Love is just a passing word
It's the thought that you had
In a taxicab that got left on the curb
When he dropped you off at East 83rd

Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now (You should know by now)
You're a native New Yorker

New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh

Music plays, everyone's dancin' closer and closer
Makin' friends and findin' lovers
There you are, lost in the shadows
Searchin' for someone (Searchin' for someone)
To set you free from New York City

And, whoa
Where did all those yesterdays go?
When you still believed
Love could really be like a Broadway show
You were the star, when did it close?

Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
No one opens the door
For a native New Yorker
(Runnin' pretty, New York City girl)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Native, native, native, ooh

Where did all those yesterdays go?
When you still believed
Love could really be like a Broadway show
You were the star

You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score
You should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker
Oh, oh, oh
(Native, native, native, native New Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker

Whoa, oh-oh-oh
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score
(Native, native, native, native New Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker

What you waitin' for?
No one opens the door
(You're a native New Yorker)
