I feel so bad, I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come with me to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be.

Oh, that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou
