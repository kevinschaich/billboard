Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in 
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love 

I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow 
Excuse me I'm only human
Sometimes I
I just don't know 

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in 
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again 
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Back in love again
Do-do-do-do-do) 
Back in love 

When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied 
I want to love you forever
I just can't
I can't decide 

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in 
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again 
(Right back, right back in love again) 
Alright (seems like, seems like) 
Back in love again 

Now it's your lover
I know it's hard just to be a friend 
That's something else I discovered
I guess I just don't ever want it to end 

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in 
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again 
(Right back, right back in love again)
(Seems like, seems like) 
That I'm back in love again 
(Right back, right back in love again) 
Alright (seems like, seems like) 
I'm back in love again 

I just don't believe it
Back in love again 
(Right back, I'm back) I can't believe it 
(Right back, I'm back) Every time I turn around
Back in love again 
(Right back, I'm back) I get so many mixed emotions
I'm back in love again 
(Right back, I'm back) Every time I turn around
Oh, my love Jones coming down
Back in love again 
(Right back, I'm back) Alright, alright, alright 
(I'm back, I'm back) 
Help me, help me, help me back in love 
(I'm back, I'm back) 
Oh yeah, back in love again 
(Right back, I'm back) 
I get so many mixed emotions, yes I do
