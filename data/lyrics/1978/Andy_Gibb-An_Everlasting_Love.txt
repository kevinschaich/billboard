I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain 

I was losing you before I ever held you tight 
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do 

Ah, we got an everlasting love 
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream                                    
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Take me out of the cold
Give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more

I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try

Ah, we got an everlasting love 
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
