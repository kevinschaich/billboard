Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65 I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69 I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes, I see they're running too

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me, you know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on) You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind) Running into the sun but I'm running behind
