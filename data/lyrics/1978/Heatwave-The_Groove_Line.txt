Pack your grip
Takin' you on a trip
Ain't no seats
All we got's dancin' feet

Leave your worries behind
'Cause rain, shine
Won't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Get this train
Know you'll be glad you came
Hit the track
Party hard there and back

Leave your worries behind (Leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine
Won't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Check out, the wheels are turnin'
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin'
We're keepin' it hot

So grab your friends
Get the train comin' through
Climb on board
Where you leave's up to you

Leave your worries behind (Leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine
Won't mind
