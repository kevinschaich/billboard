After you go, I can catch up on my reading
After you go, I'll have a lot more time for sleeping
And when you're gone, looks like things are gonna be a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue

After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no TV shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

And I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be 
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue
