I heard the weatherman
Predict a sunny day
He did not mean to lie
I look outside it's raining anyway
I guess I can live with a rainy day

'Cause in the scheme of things
You're bound lose a few
Even your best-made plans
Before you know it, they are falling through
But that couldn't happen to me oooh and you

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

My Ma she used to say
Beware the tender trap
If you get caught in one
Make sure you know just where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things
Things like that, oh, oh

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love
Baby, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
Crazy, baby
But how could I possibly lose
Ain't no way I could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love
