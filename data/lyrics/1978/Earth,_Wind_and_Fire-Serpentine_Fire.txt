When I see your face
Like a mornin' sun
You spark me to shine

Tell all the world
My need is fulfilled
And that's a new design

As long as you're near
There is no fear
Of a victory, all right

But when I'm away
Influences stray
My mind to disagree

I wanna see your face
In a morning sun
Ignite my energy, ow

The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me

Gonna tell the story
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire

Gonna tell the story
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I need to see your face
Like a morning sun
Ignite my energy, huh

The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me

The moments I find
When I'm inclined
To do my best, oh

The negative wins
When I give in and
Then I lose the test
(Not many times)

Gonna tell the story
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire

Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire

Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire

Gonna tell the story
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire

Gonna tell the story
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
