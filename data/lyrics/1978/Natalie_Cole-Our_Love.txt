You're my morning star shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love
We will last through all eternity
It's just the way we are I love it, love it
It's just the way it should be

'Cos our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will spread wide as the seas
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together, our love

My love is surely one thing
You can surely depend on
In times of darkness and fear I go to you
I know you'll make me strong
You're gonna make me happy
You're gonna make me smile

'Cos our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will be for the whole world to see
Our love will change people's wrongs to right
And we will never die
'Cos we'll always have each other, our love

Ya oo oo oo oo
Our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will spread as wide as the seas
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together
Our love, yeah our love
We got a good old fashioned love
Hey hey baby our love
We got a mighty, mighty fine love
Our love we got a mighty, mighty good love

Bring it down, just a little
Cause love is soft, love is sweet
Love is nice and love is gentle
Love is joy, love is pain
Love is laughing in the rain

I've got love on my mind
Love is always right on time
Love is you and love is me
Love is just a little baby
I've got love on my mind
Love is always right on time
Love is you and love is me
Love is gonna set you fre-eee ya
Our love, baby, our love
