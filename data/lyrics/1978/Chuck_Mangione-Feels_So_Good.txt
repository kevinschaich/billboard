There's no place for me to hide
The thoughts of all the time I cried
And felt this pain
That I have known
Because I needed just to hear
That special something

And then one day
You just appear
You said "hello"
"Let's make love along the way"
Your name is music to my heart
I'll always really love you

Feel so good when I'm with you
I can't believe you love me too
With you it feels like it should feel
With you it feels so good
