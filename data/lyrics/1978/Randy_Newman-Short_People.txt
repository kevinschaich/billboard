Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason to live

They got little hands
Little eyes
They walk around tellin' great big lies
They got little noses
And tiny little teeth
They wear platform shoes on their nasty little feet

Well I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round here

(Short people are just the same as you and I)
A fool such as I
(All men are brothers until the day they die)
It's a wonderful world

Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody to love

They got little baby legs
They stand so low
You gotta pick 'em up
Just to say hello
They got little cars that go "beep, beep, beep"
They got little voices goin' "peep, peep, peep"
They got grubby little fingers
And dirty little minds
They're gonna get you every time

Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round here
