It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right, with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It ain't right, with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It's a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It's a fool's game
