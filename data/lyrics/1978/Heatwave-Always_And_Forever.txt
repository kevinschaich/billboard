Always and forever each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you

Forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
Something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you

Forever, forever
Loving you is the thing that I plan
For a very long time
Me and you, you and me, we as one
