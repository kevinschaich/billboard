Yeah
Get off

Music may ease and end all discretion
So we can get off
We keep under the sheets with two lovelys
So we can get off

Said I hope that we get the promise, ladies
And make me get off
Take it from girls with our imagination
So we can get off

Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man

To get off, to get off, to get off, to get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off

Lookin' through that dress that drive me crazy and makes me get off
Sensuality excites my mind, it makes get off
If I were you I'd get a good perspective on how to get off
Love me wild and love me crazy, so we can get off

Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man

To get off, to get off, to get off, to get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off

Get off

So get off to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off to get off, to get off, get off
So get off, get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off to get off, get off, get off

To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off, get off, get off, to get off
Get off to get off, get off, get, get off
Get off, get off, so get off, just get off
Get off, get off, get off
