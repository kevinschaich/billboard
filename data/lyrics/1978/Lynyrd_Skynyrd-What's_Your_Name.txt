Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show
I done made some plans for later on tonight
I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right.

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Back at the hotel, lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar, What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne

What's your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
For there ain't no shame

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Nine o'clock the next day
And I'm ready to go
I got six hundred miles to ride
To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I wanna see you again

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Well there ain't no shame

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same
