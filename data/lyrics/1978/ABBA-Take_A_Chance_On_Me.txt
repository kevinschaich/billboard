If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

If you need me, let me know
Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down

If you're all alone
When the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best
And it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test
If you let me try

Take a chance on me (That's all I ask of you, honey)
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing (Aha)
We can go walking (Yeaheah)
As long as we're together (Together)

Listen to some music (Aha)
Maybe just talking (Yeaheah)
Get to know you better (Better)

'Cause you know I've got so much that I wanna do
When I dream I'm alone with you it's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know that I can't let go

If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

If you need me, let me know
Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down

If you're all alone
When the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best
And it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test
If you let me try

Take a chance on me (Come on, give me a break, will you?)
Take a chance on me

Oh, you can take your time baby (Aha)
I'm in no hurry (Yeaheah)
Know I'm gonna get you (Know I'm gonna get you)

You don't wanna hurt me (Aha)
Baby, don't worry (Yeaheah)
I ain't gonna let you (I ain't gonna let you)

Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic

You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
I know I can't let go
'Cause I love you so

If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

If you need me, let me know
Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down

If you're all alone
When the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see?
Gotta put me to the test
Take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see?
Gotta put me to the test
Take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see?
