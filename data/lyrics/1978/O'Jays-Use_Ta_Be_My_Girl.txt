Ooh, good lovin'
The girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She used ta be my girl

I, I respect her
When she was mine
I used to neglect her
Oh, she wanted more
Than I could give
But as long as I live
She'll be my girl

She, she used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl

She had a charming personality
The girl was so right for me
She's my girl
And if I had the chance
Lord knows I'd take her back
As a matter of fact
Right away like today

Not only good lookin'
The girl was so smart
You can't beat her cookin'
Oh, ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She used ta be my girl, ooh

Deep down inside
I still love her
I place no one above her
She's warm and sensitive
For as long as I live
She'll be my girl

And if I had the chance
Lord knows I'd take her back
As a matter of fact
Right away like today

Good lovin'
The girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so

She used ta be my girl, my girl
She used ta, she used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl
