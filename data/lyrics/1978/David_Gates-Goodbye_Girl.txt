All your life you've waited 
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away

I know it's hard believing
The words you've heard before
But darlin' you must trust them 
Just once more

'Cause baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again 
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away 
'Cause the things you do, my goodbye girl, will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of giving in

But I can wait forever
A-helping you to see
That I was meant for you 
And you for me

So remember goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart you still will have my heart
So forget your past, my goodbye girl
'Cause now you're home at last
