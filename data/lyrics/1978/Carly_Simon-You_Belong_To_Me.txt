Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own

You belong to me
(Tell her you were fooling)
You belong to me
(You don't even know her)
You belong to me
(Tell her that I love you)
You belong to me

You belong to me
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure

You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
Locked the door

You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell darling

You belong to me
(Tell her, tell her that I love you)
You belong to me
(You belong, you belong, you belong to me)
You belong to me
You belong to me

You belong to me
(Tell her, tell her)
You belong to me
(I've known you from a long time ago, baby)
You belong to me
(Don't leave me to go to her now)
You belong to me
