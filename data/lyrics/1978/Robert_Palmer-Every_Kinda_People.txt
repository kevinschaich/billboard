Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man upon his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life

There is no profit in deceit
Honest men know that
Revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black, or white
Each and every man's the same inside

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul
And every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
