It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you

You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, ohh
I'll give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love for first time and you said to me there's

Something, something about this place
Something 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about
Baby you and I

It's been two years since I let you go,
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock 'n' roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you
Ohh-oh ohh-oh

Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love for first time and you said to me there's

Something, something about this place
Something 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about
Baby you and I

You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I

You and I
You, you and I
Oh yeah! I'd rather die
Without you and I

C'mon!
Put your drinks up!

We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that Imma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ there's

Something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman, born to run you down
So have my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about just knowing when it's right

So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you

You and I
You, you and I
Baby! I rather die!
Without you and I

You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska! I rather die
Without you and I

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
