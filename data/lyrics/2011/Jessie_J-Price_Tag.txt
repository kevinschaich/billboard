Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and me.
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second,
Just stop for a minute and smile.

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious.
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time.

Everybody look to the left, (yeah)
Everybody look to the right,
Can you feel that? (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight.

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (ha) cha-ching, cha-ching,
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling.
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

(Okay)
We need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite.
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one gettin' tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness.
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feelin' alright.

Everybody look to the left, (to the left)
Everybody look to the right, (to the right)
Can you feel that? (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight.

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (ha) cha-ching, cha-ching,
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling.
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.


Yeah, yeah.
Well, keep the price tag,
And take the cash back.
Just give me six streams and a half stack.
And you can keep the cars,
Leave me the garage.
And all I...
Yes, all I need are keys and guitars.
And guess what, in thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars.
Yes, we leaping across these undefeatable odds.
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life.
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night.
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never,
Waiting to see us in a sign of defeat? Uh-uh.
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet,
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing.

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (ha) cha-ching, cha-ching,
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling.
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (yeah-yeah) cha-ching, cha-ching,
Ain't about the (whoo!) ba-bling, ba-bling.
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

Yeah, yeah,
Oo-oooh,
Forget about the price tag.
