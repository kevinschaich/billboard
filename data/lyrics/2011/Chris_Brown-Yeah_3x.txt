Move your body out on the floor
Put your troubles aside and start living
Anybody can let it go
Throw away all your problems 'cause right now it's party time

Girl, don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now
And I, I
I hope that this will last a while, we should make it last a while

You like to drink (Yeah!), so do we (Yeah!)
Get more bottles (Yeah!), bring them to me (Yeah!)
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air, say

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Girl, I wanna
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) I wanna see you tonight
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Girl, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) I gotta see you tonight

Ohoho, ohohoho
Ohoho, let me see your hands
Ohoho, ohohoho
Ohoho, tonight is the night

Lost in the moment, can't believe
You're so beautiful, feels like I'm in a dream
Baby, we're going somewhere you've never been before
So take my hand and come with me

Girl, don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now
And I, I
I hope that this will last a while, we should make it last a while

You like to drink (Yeah!), so do we (Yeah!)
Get more bottles (Yeah!), bring them to me (Yeah!), bring them to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air, say

All the pretty young things at the party
Let me see your hands up
And if they mad and they don't wanna party
Tell 'em shut the f*ck up!

So, DJ, turn it loud
Then watch me turn it up
Don't worry 'bout it, we here to party
So jump, jump, jump, jump
