(Laugh)
Dance!

Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No V.I.P. sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're comin' with me!

It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
This place about to—
Tonight we're takin' over, no one's getting out

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to—

Now what?
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
This place's about to—
Tonight we're taking names 'cause we don't mess around

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow...

Go, go, go, go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands

Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands

We are taking over
Get used to it

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...

This place about to blow...
