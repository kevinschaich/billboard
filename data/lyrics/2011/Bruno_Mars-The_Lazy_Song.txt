Today I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone so leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

Ah, I'm gonna kick my feet up then stare at the fan
Turn the tv on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, no

I'll be lounging on the couch just chilling in my Snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oho, yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone so leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything, nothing at all

(Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo)
Nothing at all

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90x, Meet a really nice girl
Have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: "This is great!"(Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

Oho, yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone so leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Today I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone so leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything, nothing at all

(Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo)
Nothing at all
(Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo)
Nothing at all
