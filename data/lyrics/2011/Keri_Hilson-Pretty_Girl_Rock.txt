Uh uh uh aahh uh uh
I can do the pretty girl rock rock
Rock to the pretty girl rock rock rock
Now, what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare but if you touch it imma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl that is wit ya
I ain't gotta talk about it baby you can see it
But if you want I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very

Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare but if you touch it imma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl that is wit ya

All eyes on me when I walk in,
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful

It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful

Now where you at?
If you're looking for me, you can catch me
Cameras flashing, daddy's turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?
Owoaah!

Get yourself together, don't hate (don't do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too then ladies sing it with me
