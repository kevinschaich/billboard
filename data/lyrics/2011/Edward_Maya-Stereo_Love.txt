Vika Jigulina
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
Don't let go
To my love

Can I get to your soul?
Can you get to my thoughts?
Can you promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

Both
'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm losing control

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go

Edward Maya
I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
Oh, babe, oh babe, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you

Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream, is about you and I
