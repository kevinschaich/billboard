Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Just say the words and we outta here, outta here
Hold my hand if you feeling scared, scared
We flying up, up outta here

Baby, we can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo, get your fly kicks
Girl you always on my mind, got my head up in the sky
And I'm never looking down feeling priceless, yeah

Where we at, only few would know
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, cardio
Til' then let's fly, Geronimo

J-Splif
Nah, I never been in space before
But I never seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I could touch the planets
You want the moon, girl watch me grab it

See I never seen the stars this close
You got me stuck off the way you glow
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh
