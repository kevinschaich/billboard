So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking, and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

Hey, bring it on baby, all your friends
You're the shit and I love that body
You wanna ball, explicit, I swear you're good, I won't tell nobody
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited

Hairdos and nails, that Louie, Chanel all up in the party
President's in my wallet, no rules I'm 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much

Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzzed
Holla, 'cause I'm free to whatever, it's no rush


So many boys in here, where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then he said "I'm here with my friends"
He got to thinking, and that's when he said


Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends


Peebe, Peebe who's Peabo Bryson
Two years ago I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that
You can suck a dick, you can suck on a ballsack

No, no I don't endorse that, p-p-pause that, a-a-abort that
Just the other day me go a London, saw dat, kids down the street
Paparazzi, all dat, hey, hey, what can I say?
Day day da-day day day day

Coming through the club all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football why the fuck they tryin' tackle me?
Really, I pick dude at the bar like really
Looking like he wanna good time like, really
Said he had a friend for my home girl Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily


So many girls in here where do I begin
I see this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking, and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends


Day day da-day day day day
Day day da-day day day day
Day day da-day day day day


Yo, where my girls at uh, hmm, uh
Yo, where my girls tryna get to jumpin'

So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking, that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
