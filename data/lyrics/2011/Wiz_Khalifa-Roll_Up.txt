I roll up
I roll up
I roll up
Shawty I roll up
I roll up
I roll up
I roll up


It's your anniversy, isn't it?
And your man ain't acting right
So you packin' your Domiar luggage up, callin' my cell phone,
Try and catch a flight
You know one thing straight, I'll be there girl, whenever you call me
When you at home, that's your man, soon as you land, you say that's all me
But shit ain't all "G" with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin' I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game
As long as you keep it 100 imma spend this change


Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up


I try to stay out your business
But on the real, you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up, your man's gonna get onto us
That white sand surrouding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit



No matter where I am
No matter where you are
I'll be there when it's over baby
Cause I was there from the start
No matter if I'm near
Don't matter if you're far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call


Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up
