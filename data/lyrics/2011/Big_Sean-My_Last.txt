Hands up in the air
I just want the baddest bitch in the world right here on my lap

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
'Cause I'mma drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the Certs off in this muthafucka
I'mma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muthafucka
I'mma go hard 'til it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a boss so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyoncé so do it like Beyon
Do it like Beyoncé and put it on Sean
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Now, I'mma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'mma blow this bag up like it's my last
I'mma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'mma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All all up in my face like you remember who I am
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'mma just tell you, it's everything that I expected
Bitch, boi

Hands up in the air
(I do it. One time for the West side, let me see them hands..)
Hands up in the air (boi)
(Two times if you love G.O.O.D Music)
Hands up in the air (boi boi boi boi)
(And 3 times for the baddest chick in the World who got her hands up in the air)
Hands up in the air (I do it)

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Big ass bottles, Big Ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public 'cause
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doing nothing

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

D-Town. G.O.O.D
