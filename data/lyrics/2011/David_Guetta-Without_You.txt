I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I, without you, without you

Oh, oh, oh
You, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

Can't erase so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you

I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
Lost my heart, I lost my mind, without you, without you

Oh, oh, oh
You, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same without you, without you
Without you
