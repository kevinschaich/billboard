Girl, I been thinkin' 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
But these feelings piling up won't give me no rest

This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah, maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey

You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smilin', honey, right back at me

Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well, you know I'm just havin' fun but seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty

You be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothin' left to do but fall in each other's arms

I could've said a, "I love you"
Could've wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey

You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty

You be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
I'll be your honey bee
