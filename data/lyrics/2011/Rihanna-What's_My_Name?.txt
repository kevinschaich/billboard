Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of sixty-nine is eight something, right?
'Cause I've been tryin' to work it out, oh

Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio

Ooh, let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes girl

Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as I you go, the text that I write is gon' say

Oh na na, what's my name?

Knows how to make me want it

You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge

Back and forth, you rock me, yeah

Every door you enter
