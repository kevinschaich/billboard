Yeah, yeah
When I walk on by, girls be looking like "Damn, he fly!"
I pay to the beat, walking down the street in my new Le Freak, yeah
This is how I roll, animal print pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy I got the glow

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got a passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it

I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it, yo

When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight them off
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a Speedo trying to tan my cheeks, (what?)
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt and I still get service (what?)

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got a passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it

I'm sexy and I know it, hey
I'm sexy and I know it
Check it out
Check it out

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah yeah 

Do the wiggle, man
I do the wiggle, man, yeah
I'm sexy and I know it
Hey, yeah

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
Girl, look at that body
I work out

I'm sexy and I know it
