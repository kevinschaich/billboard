Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin

Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
Yeah, I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away
Made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay

So tell em
Never gonna give you up
Whisper in his ear
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
You tell him that Jerry said he'll never let you go
So don't you think of leavin'
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Do you see these tears here in my eyes?
Ain't no use in me lyin'
Cause I really cried
You think you're gonna take me
And put me on the shelf
Girl, I'd rather die Than see you with somebody else

So throw it out of your mind
I'll never leave you
Though you grieve me and deceive me, yeah
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

My friends all say that I'm your fool 
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool 
And I know their intentions are all very good 
Some of them would help me if they could 

But I'll never, never, never, never, never let you go baby
No matter what you say 
Babe, don't you understand 
That you're killing this man?
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up 
No matter what you do to me, baby
