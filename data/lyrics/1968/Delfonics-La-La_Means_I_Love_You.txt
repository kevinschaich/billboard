Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by (passed them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try (let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even have a song to sing
All I know is

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

Oh, baby please now

Oh... baby

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me (one for me)
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see (you will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you, yes to you
Listen to me

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

Oh, you'll have to understand
Come on and take my hand
