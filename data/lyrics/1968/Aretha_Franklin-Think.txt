You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Think (think-think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back - let's go back
A let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't a been too much more than ten (just a child)

I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much I.Q.
To see what you're doing to me

You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me

Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh ya got to have
Hey! think about it
You! think about it

There ain't nothin' you could ask
I could answer you with "I won't" (I won't)
But I was gonna change my mind
If you keep doin' things I don't (don't)

You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
(What you're tryin' to do to me)
Oh-oh-oh think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walk around everyday
Playin' games and takin' scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their mind
Well, be careful you don't lose yours

Oh think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Woo-hoo, think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

And I need you (don't cha' know)
Without each other
There ain't nothin' either can do

Oh yeah, think about it, baby

Better go baby, think about it right now

Yeah, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
Woo, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
Hey, right now (tell about - forgiveness)
I need to change your mind (think about it)
Baby, baby, baby

Woo, tell about it baby (tell about - forgiveness)

Yeah, woo-hoo (tell about - forgiveness)
Tell about it baby, you think about it right now
