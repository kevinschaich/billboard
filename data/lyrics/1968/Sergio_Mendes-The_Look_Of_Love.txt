The look of love is in your eyes
A look your smile can't disguise
The look of love is saying so much more than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard, well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you 
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go You've got the

Look of love, it's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight, let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you 
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go 
Don't ever go

I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
