You take a bus marked "Lakewood Drive" 
And you keep on drivin' till you're out of the city 
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin pine 
And the countryside's pretty 
And you'll see daffodils peepin over 
The hills or a honey lovin' mama bear 

You just take a left at the bridge 
Go down to Quakerforn Ridge 
And in a minute you're there 
(dupe do be do do do ) 

Indian Lake is a scene 
You should make with your little one 
Keep it in mind if you're lookin to find 
A place in the summer sun 
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove 
Or you can rent a canoe at Indian Lake 
You'll be able to make the way the Indians do
