You are all the woman I need
And baby you know it (know it, know it, know it)
You can make this beggar a king
A clown or a poet (poet, poet, poet)

I'll give you all that I own
You got me standing in line
Out in the cold
Pay me some mind

Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
You got the power to turn on the light

Everybody tells me I'm wrong
To want you so badly (badly, badly, badly)
But there's a force driving me on
I follow it gladly (gladly, gladly, gladly)

So let them laugh I don't care
Cause I got nothing to hide
All that I want is you by my side

Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
You got the power to turn on the light

Yeah, bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
You got the power
