If you stay, stay darling
(Stay in my corner)
You make me so proud, stay darling
Please, stay
  (Stay in my corner)

To the world I'd cry my love
How I love you
Honey, I love you, I really love you
  (Stay, stay, stay, stay)
Please, please, please stay darling
(Stay in my corner)

And I will never, never let you down
Just say you'll stay
(Stay in my corner)
'Cause I'll need you always around
To tell me you love me
Honey, you love me, so darling stay
(Stay, stay, stay)

There'll be times when I may fail
I'll need your love to sometimes comfort me
Bitter days may prevail but just a kiss from you
Will make them sweet, stay
  (Stay, stay, stay)
But just a kiss from you
Will make them sweet

Honey, I love you
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay in my corner)
I love you

I love you
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay in my corner)

Don’t you know baby
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay)
I love you
(Stay in my corner)
