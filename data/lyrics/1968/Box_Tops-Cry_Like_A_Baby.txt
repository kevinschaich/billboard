When I think about the good love you gave me,
I cry like a baby.
Living without you is driving me crazy,
I cry like a baby.
Well, I know now that you're not a play thing,
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string.

As I look back on a love so sweet now,
I cry like a baby.
Every road is a lonely street,
I cry like a baby.
I know now that you're not a play thing,
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string.

Today we passed on a street,
And you just walked on by.
My heart just fell to my feet,
And once again I began to cry.

When I think about the good love you gave me,
I cry like a baby.
Living without you is driving me crazy,
I cry like a baby.

I know now that you're not a play thing,
I cry like a baby.
As I look back on a love so sweet now,
I cry like a baby.
Every road is a lonely street,
I cry like a baby.
My heart just fell to my feet, you know 
I cried like a baby.
You left the water running now, 
I cried like a baby.
