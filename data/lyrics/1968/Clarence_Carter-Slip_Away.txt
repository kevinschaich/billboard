What would I give for just a few moments
What would I give just to have you near
Tell me you will try to slip away somehow
Oh, I need you darling, I want to see you right now

Can you slip away, slip away, slip away, yeah
Oh, I need you so

Love, oh love, how sweet it is
When you're still in, darling, let me tell you something now
How sweet it is

Now I know it's wrong, the things I ask you to do
But please believe me darling, I don't mean to hurt you
But could you just slip away without him knowing you're gone
Then we could meet somewhere, somewhere where we're both unknown

Can you just, can you slip away, slip away, slip away, yeah
I need you so

Oh, can you slip away, baby
I'd like to see you right now, darling
Can you slip away now, baby
'Cause I got to, I got to see you
I feel a deep burning inside
