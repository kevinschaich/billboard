Everybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste it ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here all the pigeons gonna run to him

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste ain't my cup of meat
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everyone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want to doze

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
