I like to dream
Yes, yes, right between my sound machine
On a cloud of sound, I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes, girl
Look inside, girl
Let the sound take you away

Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around
A lousy candle's all I found

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes, girl
Look inside, girl
Let the sound take you away

You don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free
