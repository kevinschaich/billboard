Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Yeah, darling go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and
Explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Yeah darling go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild
