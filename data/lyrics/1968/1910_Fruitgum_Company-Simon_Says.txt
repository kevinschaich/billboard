I'd like to play a game
That is so much fun
And it's not so very hard to do
The name of the game is Simple Simon says
And I would like for you to play it too

Put your hands in the air
(Simple Simon says)
Shake them all about
(Simple Simon says)
Do it when Simon says
(Simple Simon says)
And you will never be out

Simple Simon says
Put your hands on your head
Let your back bone stretch
Simon says

Simple simon says
Put your hands on your head
Let your back bone stiff
Simon says

Put your hands on your head
(Simple Simon says)
Bring them down by your side
(Simple Simon says)
Shake them to your left
(Simple Simon Says)
Now shake them to your right

Put your hands on your head
(Simple Simon says)
Bring them down by your side

Shake them to your left

Now shake them to your right

To play this game with me
You can see its not so hard to do
Lets try it once again
This time more carefully
And I hope the winner will be you

Clap your hands in the air

Slow it down like before

Slow it down like before
