All the world over, so easy to see 
People everywhere just wanna be free 
Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be
There's peace in the valley, people got to be free 

You should see what a lovely, lovely world this'd be 
Everyone learned to live together, ah hah
Seems to me such an itty bitty thing should be 
Why can't you and me learn to love one another? 

All the world over, so easy to see 
People everywhere just wanna be free (wanna be free)
I can't understand it, so simple to me 
People everywhere just got to be free

If there's a man who is down and needs a helpin' hand 
All it takes is you to understand and to pull him through, ah hah
Seems to me we got to solve it individually, ah ah
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
Said, no

Shout it from the mountain on out to the sea
No two ways about it, people have to be free (they gotta be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be 
Natural situation for a man to be free
Get right on board now, huh, huh

Oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
Peace in the valley now, we all can be free

See that train over there?
Now that's the train of freedom
It's about to 'rrive any minute, now
You know it's been'a long, long overdue
Look out 'cause it's a'comin' right on through
Ha, ha, yeah
