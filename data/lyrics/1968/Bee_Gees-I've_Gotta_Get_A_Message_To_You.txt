The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said, "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile.
Now for once in your life you're alone.
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone."

I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart, won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go

I've just go to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

Well I laughed but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die

I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
