Cab Driver, drive by Mary's place
I just wanna chance to see her face
Don't stop the meter, let it race
Cab Driver, drive by Mary's place

Cab Driver, once more round the block
Never mind the ticking of the clock
I only wish we could have a talk
Cab Driver, once more round the block

Cab Driver, once more down the street
There's a little place we used to meet
That's where I laid my future at her feet
Cab Driver, once more down the street

Cab Driver, wait here by the door
Perhaps I'll hold her in my arms once more
Then thing's will be just like before
Cab Driver, wait here by the door

Cab Driver, better take me home
I guess that I was meant to be alone
I hope God sends me a love one of my own
Cab Driver, better take me home

Cab Driver, better take me home!
