Oh, Western Union man 
Send a telegram to my baby 
Send a telegram, send a telegram, whoa
Send a telegram to my baby 

This is what I want you to say
I want you to tell her that I'm all alone
I tried to call her on the phone 
Tell her I'm in misery
And think she's avoiding me 
And if the telegram don't do 
Send a box of candy too 
And maybe some flowers 
Tell her that I missed her for hours and hours 

Send a telegram, send a telegram
Send a telegram, man, to my baby
You hear what I say 

Oh, Western Union man
Send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram to my baby 
Western Union man, hey
Send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram, send a telegram, whoa
Send a telegram, man, to my baby

This is what I want you to do (listen)
Tell me, have you got a boy you can send 
This is what I want him to do
Put him on his bike right away 
See if he can get my message through 
Maybe tomorrow, but mail it right away 
I want the girl to know that I miss her 
Something like yesterday 

Send a telegram, send a telegram man, whoa 
Send a telegram, man, to my baby
Do you hear what I say 

Oh, Western Union man 
Why don't you send a telegram
Oh, send a telegram to my baby
Western Union man
Please send a telegram
Oh, send it, send a telegram, send it
Send it, send it, sent it right on to my baby 
Do you hear what I say

Hey, Western Union man 
Send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram to my baby
