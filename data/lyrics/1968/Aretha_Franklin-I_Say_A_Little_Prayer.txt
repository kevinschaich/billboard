(Say a little prayer for you)

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
I say a little prayer for you
And while I'm combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now (wear, now)
I say a little prayer for you

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(We never will part oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(That's how it must be to live without you)
Would only mean heartbreak for me, ooh

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear (us, dear)
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time (break-time)
I say a little prayer for you

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(We never will part oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)
Nobody but me

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(We never will part oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, together
(That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)

My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
(Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer babe
(Answer my prayer)
Say you love me too
(Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer babe
(Answer my prayer)

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(We never will part oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)

My darling believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
This is my prayer (This my prayer)
Answer my prayer now, babe (Answer my prayer, babe)
This my prayer (Answer my prayer, babe)
Answer it right now babe (Answer my prayer, babe)
Say you love me (Answer my prayer, babe)
This my prayer babe (Answer my prayer, babe)
I'm in love with you
