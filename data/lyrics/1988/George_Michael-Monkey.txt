Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye, uh-huh)

Oh, I count to ten 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open my eyes 
If you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then

I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best
So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Well I'd write your heart a letter
But I think you know me better
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe I'll get what I'm askin' for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it? 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Oh I hate your friends 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open your eyes 
Yes the monkey's back again 
Do you want him now like you did back then? 

I tried my best
But your head is such a mess
So I guess that I don't want you anymore

Well you say you care about me
That you just can't do without me 
But you keep on dancin' baby 
Till that monkey has you on the floor

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your

So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)
