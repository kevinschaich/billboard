Prove your love 
Got to prove your love 
I hear all about what you can do 
But I got to know 
Is it true 
Your telling me to trust 
What should I believe 
You promised so much 
But talk is cheap 
You tell me that you're serious 
But I gotta know for sure 
You say how much you want me 
But I've heard it all before 

(Prove your love, Gotta prove your love 
If you want to be with me tonite 
Show your stuff , Cause words are not enough 
I want to hear your body talk to mine) 

Boy I can feel a love is on the rise 
A message revealed in your eyes 
You know I can't wait 
To know your passion 
It's not to late 
So take some action 
Can you say that when you're through 
I'll know what love is all about 
Well, baby I've been patient, now 
I'm ready to find out 
Chorus 
You can tell me that your serious 
But I gotta know for sure 
You say that you want me 
But I've heard it all before 
Prove your love gotta prove your love 
If you want to be with me tonight 
Show your stuff, cause words 
Are not enough 
I want to hear your body 
Repeat
