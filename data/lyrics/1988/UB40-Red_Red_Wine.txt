Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so

Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
You keep me rockin' all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand

Red red wine, you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line

(Red red wine)
Red red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing, you make me do my own thing
(It's up to you)
Red red wine, you really know how fi love
Your kind of lovin' like a blessing from above

Red red wine, I loved you right from the start
Right from the start with all of my heart
Red red wine in an eighties style
Red red wine in a modern beat style, yeah

(I'd have sworn)
Give me a little time, help me clear up my mind
(That with time)
Give me a little time, help me clear up my mind
(Thoughts of you would leave my head)
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line
The line broke, the monkey get choked
Burn bad ganja pon his little rowing boat

(Red red wine)
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you 'cause I know your love true
(Stay close to me)
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you till I die
Love you till I die, and that's no lie

(Don't let me be alone)
Red red wine, can't get you off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find
(It's tearin' apart)
I'll surely find, make no fuss
(My blue, blue heart)
Just stick with us

(I'd have sworn)
Give me a little time, help me clear up my mind
(That with time)
Give me a little time, help me clear up my mind
(Thoughts of you would leave my head)
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line
The line broke, the monkey get choked
Burn bad ganja pon his little rowing boat
