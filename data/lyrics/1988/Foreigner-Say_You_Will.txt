Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Wanna be mine

Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you will
Be mine tonight

I can't sleep
I keep dreaming I'm losing you
Feel so alone in the night
Scared to open my eyes

I'm in too deep
I'm in over my head this time
Can't get you out of my mind
No matter how hard I try

So won't you
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you won't
Be my guiding light

Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you do, say you do
You wanna be mine

I get the feeling
I've never been here before
'Cause no one I've known's
Ever moved me the way that you do

And I know this is the real thing
It's all I've been searching for
I've put it all on the line
Now I'm hoping you feel that way too

And if you do, why don't you
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Wanna be mine

Now will you say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you will
You will be mine tonight

Will you tell me how much I mean to you?
Will you say you always will be true?
I need more than a come-on sign
So won't you say you will be mine

Now won't you
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be my guiding light

Say you will, say you will
Make up your mind this time
Say you do, say you do
You wanna be mine

Come on, come on
Say you will
Make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be mine tonight

Be mine tonight
Say you will be mine tonight, yeah
Say you will be mine tonight
Say you will, say you will
