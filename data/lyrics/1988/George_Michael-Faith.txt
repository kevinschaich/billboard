Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes, I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I got to have faith

I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I've just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
