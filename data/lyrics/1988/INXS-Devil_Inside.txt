Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind 
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
Other half die 

Makes you wonder 
Oh-oh-wonder

Here come the man
With the look in his eye
Fed on nothing
But full of pride 

Look at them go
Look at them kick
Makes you wonder
How the other half live 

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside 
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside 

Here come the world
With the look in its eye
Future uncertain
But certainly slight 

Look at the faces
Listen to the bells
It's hard to believe
We need a place called hell
A place called hell 

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside 
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside 

Here comes the woman
With the look in her eye
She's raised on leather
With flesh on her mind 

Words are weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die 

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside 
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

The devil inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The devil inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah
