Fortunately you have got someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in
The symptoms are so deep
It's so much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play
I'd rather be in hell with you baby
Than in cool heaven, it seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines bright
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you, makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love, and the earth rotates to our dictates
Slowly we make love...............

Sign your name across my heart......
