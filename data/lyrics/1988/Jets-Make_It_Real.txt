Tonight, it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart, I'll pretend
That you are here again

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

Give me one more chance to
Make it real
