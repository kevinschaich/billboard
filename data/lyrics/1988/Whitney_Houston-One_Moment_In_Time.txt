Each day I live, I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart, for every gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

You need one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance, here in my hands

You need one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

You need one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free

Oh, you're a winner, for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time, make it shine

You need one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

You need one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free
Oh, I will be, I will be free
