When I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up
My tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk; can't talk
Can't eat; can't sleep
Oh I'm in love
Oh I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak
I get weak

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where I want to be
'Cause lover
Like a wave you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this, I don't know
I just know that there's no way to fight it
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
I get weak

I get weak!
I get weak!

Just a kiss you can strip me defenseless
Just a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Woah...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes

I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
