Hey

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
Till things get out of control, oh

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever, oh
How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson, uh

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever, oh
How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together

(Oh oh, oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh, oh oh) You can feel it, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Nothing's missing, yeah

(Oh oh, oh oh) Yeah, you can feel it
(Oh oh, oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh, oh oh)
When nothing's missing, ow

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever, ooh
How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together, hey

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love
Ooh, when it's love
Hey, it'll last forever

(Na na na na na na) When it's love
