You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart

And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
Am not the desperate type

If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no no no no no, I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together (Haaoo)
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe (Yeeaaah)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Oh, baby, yeah
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
(Oh baby, I do)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves (Just give me one more try)
In love again

I had a dream
(I miss your love)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
(Yeah, I still believe)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves (Baby)
In love again
