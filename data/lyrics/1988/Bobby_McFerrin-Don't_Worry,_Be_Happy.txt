Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) 
Be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Here, I'll give you my phone number
When you're worried, call me
I'll make you happy)

Ooo-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't do it, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It will soon pass, whatever it is
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm not worried
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
