If a boy had a chance
A chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart
Let him cry for the moon

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(I just freeze)

I just freeze every time 
You see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue

(On my knees)
On my knees
Help me baby 
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

Oh, I had a dream
For a moment I believed it was true
Oh I'd have given anything 
Just to be there with you

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(I just freeze)

I just freeze every time 
You see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue

(In too deep) 
In too deep
Standing here waiting 
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue

(I can see)
I can see
Can see that it may be 
Just a vision of you
Electric blue

(On my knees) 
On my knees
Help me baby 
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

(Help me baby)

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(In those eyes)

I just freeze
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue

(In too deep) 
In too deep
Standing here waiting 
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue

(I can see)
I can see
Can see that it may be 
Just a vision of you
Electric blue

(On my knees) 
On my knees
Help me baby 
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

(In those eyes)
I just freeze 
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue

(In too deep)
In too deep
Standing here waiting 
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue

(I can see) I can see
Can see that it 
May be just a vision of you
Electric blue

(On my knees)
On my knees
Help me baby 
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

Electric blue
Electric blue
Electric blue
