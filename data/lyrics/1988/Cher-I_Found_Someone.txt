Don't you know 
So many things, they come and go 
Like your words that once rang true 
Just like the love I thought I found in you 

And I remember the thunder 
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes 
But you walked away when I needed you most 
Now maybe baby, maybe baby 

I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone 

Dry your eyes 
I never could bear to see you cry 
Someday your love will shine through 
And show you the feelings that you never really knew 

But baby don't you loose that thunder 
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes 
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe 
That maybe baby, maybe baby 

I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone 

Too long on the border line 
Wondering if your love was really mine 
But you left me with open eyes 
And when I realized 

Baby 
I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 

Baby 
I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone
