It's worked so far, but we're not out yet

I wanna know 
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know 
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy
Pure energy

Here I am in silence
Looking 'round without a clue
I find myself alone again
All alone with you

I can see behind your eyes
The things that I don't know
If you hide away from me
How can our love grow? 

I wanna know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

I know I could break you down
But what good would it do?
I could surely never know
That what you say is true

Here I am in silence
It's a game I have to play
You and I in silence
With nothing else to say

I wanna know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know 
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy
Pure energy 

Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy

I wanna know
What you're thinking  
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know 
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

I wanna know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind
