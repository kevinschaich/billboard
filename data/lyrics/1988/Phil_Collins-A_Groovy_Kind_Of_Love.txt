When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue

When you're close to me
I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to
You can turn me onto
Anything you want to
Anytime at all

When I kiss your lips
Ooh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love

Oh

When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue

When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love

We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
Oh
We got a groovy kind of love
