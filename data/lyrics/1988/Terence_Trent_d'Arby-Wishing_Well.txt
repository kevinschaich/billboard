Kissing like a bandit, stealing time
Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Slowly but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler

Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up
Beat that, uh

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, c'mon
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, uh

Yeah, I feel like goin' on
C'mon, c'mon
You're my midnight rambler, baby
Wooh, dig it, for you anywhere
But all I know is what I want, baby
