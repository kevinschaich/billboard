Wait - Wait - I never had a chance to love you
Now I only wanna say I love you one more time

Wait - just a moment before our love will die
'Cause I - must know the reason why we say goodbye
Wait - just a moment and tell me why
Cause I - can show you lovin' that you won't deny

Wait - and show your lovin' like it was before
Cause I - won't let that feelin' walk out through the door
I said wait - just a moment and try once more
'Cause babe - I need to hold you like I did before

So if you go away - I know that I will follow
'Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out

Oh, baby - wait - wait - I never had a chance to love you
Wait - wait - if only our love could show you
Wait - wait - I never wanna be without you
Wait - wait - no I never had a chance to love you
Now I only wanna say I love you one more time

solo

So if you go away - I know that I will follow
'Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out

Oh, baby - wait - wait - I never had a chance to love you
Wait - wait - if only our love could show you
Wait - wait - I never wanna be without you
Wait - wait - no I never had a chance to love you
Now I only wanna say I love you... (wait...)

Baby, I beg you to wait
No I never had a chance to love you
