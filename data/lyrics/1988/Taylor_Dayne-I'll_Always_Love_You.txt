I'll always love you 
For the rest of my days 
You have won my heart and my soul 
With your sweet, Sexy ways 
You gave me hope 
When I needed someone near 
You bring me happiness 
Everyday of every year 
And I'll always love you 
For all that you are 
You have made my life complete 
You're my lucky star 
Your are the one 
That I'd been searching for 
You are my everything 
Tell me who could ask for more 
And I'll always love you 
Honey, this will never end 
I need you by my side, baby 
You're my lover my friend 
Oh, my friend 
You gave my world 
A thrill I've never known 
And filled my eager heart 
With a love to call my own 
And I'll always love you 
You must know how much I do 
You can count on me forever 
And I will take good care 
Of you 
I'll always love you 
I'm so happy that your mine 
I always love you 
Till the end of time
