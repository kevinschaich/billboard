Now listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet, no

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same-old same-old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry 'bout the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same-old same-old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

You see I, I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away, yeah
Here's to ya

Mmm, guitar

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

It don't get better, baby
