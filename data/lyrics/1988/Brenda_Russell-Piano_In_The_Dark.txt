When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart (thief of the heart)
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
It's pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
In the dark...

The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk to the door (just a little more time)
I can feel your emotion (can't you feel my emotion)
Oh baby, pullin' me back (just a little more time)
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
I cry, I cry

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
In the dark

I can't let go...
