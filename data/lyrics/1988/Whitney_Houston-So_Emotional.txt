I don't know why I like it
I just do
Ooh, ooh

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much uh

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do, hee

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

Ooh, I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much, no

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do, hee hee

See I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much, no no no

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
