Forty seven dead beats living in the back street 
North, east, west, south, all in the same house 
Sitting in a back room, waiting for the big boom 
I'm in a bedroom waiting for my baby 

She's so mean but I don't care 
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair 
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west 
The wild, wild west (wild west)

Well, Mandy's in the backroom, handing out Valium 
Sheriff's on the airwaves, talking to the D.J.'s 
Forty seven heartbeats beating like a drum 
Got to live it up, live it up, Ronnie's got a new gun 

She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties 
Living in the wild, wild west 
The wild, wild west (wild west) Yeow

Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down 
You can live it up, live it up all over the town 
And turn to the left, turn to the right 
I don't care as long as she comes tonight 

She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (wild west)
Yeow, wild west

Brrrr, here come a musical disc
'Cause some people them a-keep waitin' for
This one's called the outlaw, wow
They want me
Ride the rhythm like me ridin' a bike
Shine on me
Murder me chatter when me chat on the mic
Shorties thought this could keep them rockin' 'til the broad daylight
And here comes the Escape Club to rock it all night, say

Live it up, live it up
Live it up, live it up

Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
(Wild west)

Heading for the nineties, living in the eighties 
Screaming in a back room, waiting for the big boom 
Give me, give me wild west, give me, give me safe sex 
Give me love, give me love, give me time to live it up 

Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down 
You can live it up, live it up all over the town 
And turn to the left, turn to the right 
I don't care as long as she comes tonight 

She's so mean but I don't care 
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair 
Dance to the beat that we like best 
Heading for the nineties 
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west 
The wild, wild west (wild west)
Yeow, wild west
