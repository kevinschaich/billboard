Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road

Standing like a stone on the old plantation
The rich old man would have never let him in
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on alone, alone
