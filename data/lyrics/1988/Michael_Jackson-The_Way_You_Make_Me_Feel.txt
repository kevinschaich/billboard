(Hee! - hee!)
(Ooh!)
(Go on girl!)
(Aaow!)

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever
Like I've never, forever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me...

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
Now baby - hee!
(You knock me off my feet)
My lonely days are gone -
A - acha - acha
(My lonely days are gone)
Acha - ooh!

Go on girl!
Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
Go on girl!

I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me...

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
Now baby - hee!
(You knock me off my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
Now baby - hee!
(You knock me off my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

Ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby

Hee hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
Hee hee! Ooh!
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me - give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl - I wanna
Be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby's
(My lonely days are gone)
Go on girl! Aaow!

Chika - chika - chika
Go on girl! - Hee hee!

Hee hee hee!

Give it to me - give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl - I wanna
Be with mine

Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby's
(My lonely days are gone)
Go on girl! 
Give it to me - give me some time
