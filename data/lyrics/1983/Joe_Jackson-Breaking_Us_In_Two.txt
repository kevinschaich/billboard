Don't you feel like trying something new?
Don't you feel like breaking out or breaking us in two?
You don't do the things that I do
You wanna do things I can't do
Always something breaking us in two

You and I could never live alone
But don't you feel like breaking out just one day on your own?
Why does what I'm saying hurt you?
I didn't say that we were through
Always something breaking us in two

They say two hearts should beat as one for us
We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that won't be too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice
It's oh so hard to do

Could we be much closer if we tried?
We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes
Maybe we could last an hour
Maybe then we'd see right through
Always something breaking us in two

They say two hearts should beat as one for us
