Girl, tell me only this
That I'll have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words, "I'll always love you."

And forever
I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there

Now, I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy my heart and soul can give

Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever

Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl
I'm truly head over heels with your love
I need you
And with your love I'm free
And truly
You know you're alright with me
