I can tell you that love
Is too deep to be played on
Down the line, you'd find
Time would reveal who to count on

I'm well inclined to use the lines
That comes from the learning tree
Yeah, yeah, let the seed that grows
And ages old give us our destiny

Baby, you know
I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would build you up
Never let you down
If you fall in love with me

If you're having
Second thoughts from the past
I can cool you out
I've been there before
Right down to the core
I can sing and shout

I can't hold back what I feel
I bring experience
I'll be your rock
When Gibraltar falls
Baby, give me a cause

Baby, you know
I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would build you up
Never let you down
If you fall in love with me

Baby (oh, baby) in love with me
Find yourself a part of me
Baby, in love with me
Help yourself to all of me

I've got your number
And I wanna shout
(Falling in love)
I dig you, baby
Come and check me out
(Falling in love, baby)

Baby, you know
I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would build you up
Never let you down
If you fall in love with me


Baby, in love with me
Find yourself a part of me
Baby, in love with me
Help yourself to all of me

Ba ba ba ba ba....
Can you fall in love, oh, baby
Hey, baby, can you
Fall in love with me, yeah

I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would build you up (oh, baby)
Never let you down
If you fall in love with me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ba ba ba ba ba...
Can you fall in love with me...
