Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers
Showers
Who's got the new boy gender

I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble...

Uptown their sound
Is like the native
You send her
Junction
Function
The boy with pop is slender

Did he say maybe
Or I'm not sure
He'll be a boy for you
But you need more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble...

I get a crazy feeling
That chases in my head
It's nothing that you do to me
It's nothing that you said
It's love in stereo
And when I can't let go I say

I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble...

Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers
Showers
Who's got the new boy gender

I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble...
