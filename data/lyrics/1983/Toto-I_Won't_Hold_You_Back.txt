If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can't erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
I guess I have myself to blame
Time can't erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one instead

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found 
You know I can't hold you back now

Now that I'm alone it gives me time 
To think about the years that you were mine
Time can't erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found 
(Listen to me baby)
You know I can't hold you back now

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
