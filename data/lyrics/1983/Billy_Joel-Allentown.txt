Well, we're living here in Allentown 
And they're closing all the factories down 
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time 
Filling out forms 
Standing in line 

Well, our fathers fought the second World War 
Spent their weekends on the Jersey shore 
Met our mothers in the USO 
Asked them to dance 
Danced with them slow 

And we're living here in Allentown 
But the restlessness was handed down 
And it's getting very hard to stay 

Well we're waiting here in Allentown 
For the Pennsylvania we never found 
For the promises our teachers gave 
If we worked hard 
If we behaved 

So the graduations hang on the wall 
But they never really helped us at all 
No they never taught us what was real 
Iron and coke 
Chromium Steel 

And we're waiting here in Allentown 
But they've taken all the coal from the ground 
And the union people crawled away 

Every child had a pretty good shot 
To get at least as far as their old man got 
But something happened on the way to that place 
They threw an American flag in our face 

Well, I'm living here in Allentown 
And it's hard to keep a good man down 
But I won't be getting up today 

And it's getting very hard to stay 
And we're living here in Allentown
