Hey, man, I don't feel like goin' to school no more
Me neither, they can't make you go, no you daddy, oh yeah

I ain't goin' to school, it starts too early for me
Well, listen man, I ain't goin' to school no more
It starts much, much too early for me
I don't care about readin', writin', 'rithmetic or history

I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
Well, she's the only girl in this whole world who understands me

Well, she's sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound, shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine

Johnny and Eddie and me and Jimmy and Jack
Are gonna do a little number on the teacher when she turns her back
We're gonna cut out of class, meet the girls by the railroad track

Well ev'ry Friday night, there's a band that you gotta hear
Just a dollar ticket in and twenty-five cents a beer
They play rock n' roll music like it hasn't been rocked for years

Well, she's sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine, all mine

Oh c'mon, baby, yeah

Well, when I hear that rockin' beat, I can't sit still up out of my seat
Come on babe, let's jump around your feet
Can't learn nothin' in school, they don't teach you on the street

Wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I like your style
Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, I like your style
You don't care what the other kids say, you go real wild

Well, you're sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine, mine
Dig that sound and shake it around you're mine, mine, mine, mine
Dig that sound and shake it around you're mine, mine, mine
