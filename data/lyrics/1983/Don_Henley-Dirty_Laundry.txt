I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry

Well, I could've been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde, comes on at five
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die
Give us dirty laundry

Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set
We need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone
Keep your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around)

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
Love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry

We can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
