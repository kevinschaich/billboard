Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it

You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her hair against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Ooh, oh
Oh

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac, at your door (at your door)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
