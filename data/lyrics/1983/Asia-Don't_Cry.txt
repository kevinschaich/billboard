Hard Times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You girl, you've always been mistreated, cheated

So leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever
And more, more, oh

Don't cry, now that I've found you
Don't cry, take a look around you
Don't cry, it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

I knew I'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think of all that's been before

I'll hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry, I will always be there
Like never before, oh, oh

Don't cry, now that I've found you
Don't cry, take a look around you
Don't cry, it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

Don't cry, now that I've found you
Don't cry, take a look around you
Don't cry, it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

Don't cry, now that I've found you
Don't cry, take a look around you
Don't cry, it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry (don't cry)
Don't cry (don't cry)

Don't cry (don't cry)
Don't cry (take a look around you)
Don't cry

Don't cry (take a look around you)
