(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
Ooh, baby let's get down tonight, whoo

Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab ahold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate

(Heal me, my darling)
(Heal me, my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
I got to have sexual healing, darling, 'cause I'm all alone
Sexual healing, darling, till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate
