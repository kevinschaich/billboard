I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle,
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love, love)
