I'm tired of playing on the team
It seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score

Oh oh I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh yeah, you've got to understand baby
Time out is what I'm here for

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that 
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow 

You can't tell me you don't miss me girl
I think I might know you too well 
Wonder what you'd say if you knew that I was coming tonight
Want to? I want you can't you tell 

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that 
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow 
That's all you need to know now

'Cause if it's really right there's nothing else
One on one I want to play that game tonight...
