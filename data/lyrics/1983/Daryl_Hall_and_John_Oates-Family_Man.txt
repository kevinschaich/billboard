She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose 
As she presented herself

She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain 
That she was his for a price

But he said leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone, I'm a family man
But if you push me too far I just might

She wore hurt surprise 
As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride 
She made it totally clear 
That she was his for a night

But he said leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone, I'm a family man
But if you push me too far I just might

She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide 
If he should hold his ground

But he said leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone, I'm a family man
But if you push me too far I just might

She turned, tossed her head 
Unlike her opening move
Her final exit line
He waited much too long 
But by the time he got his courage up 
She was gone

Then he screamed leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone, I'm a family man
But if you push me too far, I just might
