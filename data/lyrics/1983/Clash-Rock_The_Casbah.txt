Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top

The sheikh, he drove his Cadillac
He went a-cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a-standin'
On the radiator grille

The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

By order of the Prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound

But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb

As soon as the sharif
Had cleared the square
They began to wail

The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing

But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive!

The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

The king called up his jet fighters
He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way

As soon as the sharif was chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare
As soon as the sharif was outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

The sharif don't like it (He thinks it's not kosher)
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it (Fundamentally he can't take it)
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

The sharif don't like it (You know he really hates it!)
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
