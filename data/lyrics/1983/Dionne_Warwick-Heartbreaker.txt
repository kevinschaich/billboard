I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down 
How can I love you when you ain't around

And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you, love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
My love for you

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Tell me, why do you have to be a heartbreaker
