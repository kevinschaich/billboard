Where were you when I needed you?
Well, you could not be found
What can I do?  Oh, I believed in you
You're running me around

Well, you can take it as a warning
Or take it any way you like
It's the lightning, not the thunder
You never know when it's going to strike

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh

Don't be cute, don't be funny now
It's later than you think
Oh, what's the use? Oh, save your money now
It's hanging on the brink

Don't let go while I'm hanging on
'Cause I've been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone
I know you're not that strong, yeah, yeah

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh

Don't let go
While I'm hanging on
'Cause I've been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone
I know you're not that strong, yeah, yeah

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Ooh
