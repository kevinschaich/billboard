Ha!

It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
But she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!) 
Failed me in geometry, hey-ey, huh, huh

Now
Huh, huh

When I'm dancing close to her
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
I can smell the chemicals
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
(Science!)

Now, but, it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
Sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!) 
Failed me in geometry
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)

When she's dancing next to me
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
(Hmm hmm, hmm hmm, hmm)
I can hear machinery
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)

Ha! It's poetry in motion
Now she's making love to me
The spheres are in commotion
The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And hit me with technology

(Good heavens, Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!)

I -
I don't believe it!
There she goes again!
She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!
All my tubes and wires
And careful notes
And antiquated notions 
But it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Huh, she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with - with science!)
She blinded me with 
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
