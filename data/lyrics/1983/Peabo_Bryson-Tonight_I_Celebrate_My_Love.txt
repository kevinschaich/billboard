Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, tonight
