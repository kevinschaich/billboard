Ooh, ooh

Listen boy
Don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make
The same mistakes I made

She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Oh, listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Wooh, wooh

Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Everyday before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

'Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that
Won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long

You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late

You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell
