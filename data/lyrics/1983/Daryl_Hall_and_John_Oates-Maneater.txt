She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you 
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see 
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love 
You ain't gonna get too far

Ohh, here she comes
Watch out boy, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Ohh, here she comes
Watch out boy, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
And she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there
But a beast is in the heart

Ohh, here she comes
Watch out boy, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Ohh, here she comes
Watch out boy, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Ohh, here she comes (Here she comes)
Watch out boy, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes (Watch out)
She's a maneater
Ohh, here she comes (She's a maneater)
Ooh, she'll chew you up
Ohh, here she comes
Here she comes, she's a maneater

Ohh, here she comes (Watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
Ohh, here she comes
Here she comes, she's a maneater
Ohh, here she comes (She's a maneater)
The woman is wild, ooh
Ohh, here she comes
Here she comes
Watch out boy, watch out boy

Ohh, here she comes
Ohh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
Ohh, here she comes (Watch out)
Yeah yeah, maneater
Ohh, here she comes (She's a maneater)
Watching and waiting
Ohh, here she comes
Ohh, she's a maneaater
