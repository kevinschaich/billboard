Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears

Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
(Time, time, time...)

Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the heat too much
I felt I lost you from the start

Ooh, in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
(Time, time, time...)

Ooh, in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time

And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time

And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
