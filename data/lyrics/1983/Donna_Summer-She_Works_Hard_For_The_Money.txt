She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

I met her there in the corner stands
And wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything

9 a.m. on the hour hand and
She's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
She's waiting for her clientèle

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there

It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She already knows she's seen her bad times
She already knows these are the good times
She'll never sell out
She never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard...

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
All right

She works hard for the money (hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (hard, hard, hard for it honey)
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money (hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (hard, hard, hard for it honey)
