Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

"Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty."
And he said:

"Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."
