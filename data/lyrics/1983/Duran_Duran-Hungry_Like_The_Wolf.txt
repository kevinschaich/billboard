Dark in the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is a fire
(Do dododo dododo dododo dododo doo doo)
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
(Do dododo dododo dododo dododo doo doo)

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
(Do dododo dododo dododo dododo doo doo)
Higher blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
(Do dododo dododo dododo dododo doo doo)

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
