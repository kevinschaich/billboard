I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart 

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart

Oh
Don't ever leave me darlin'

Oh straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go- as long as I know 
You'll give it to me now
Straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
Give it to me
Oh no, oh no 
Straight from the heart 
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
