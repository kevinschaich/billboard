What can I do?
Pictures of you still make me cry
Trying to live without your love
It's so hard to do
Some nights I wake up
I look at your pillow
Hoping that I'll see you there
But I get up each day
Not much to say
I've nowhere to go
Loneliness fills me up inside
Cause I'm missing you
So if you'll give us a chance to remember
The love we had once together
Wait and See
Time is all that we really need
I'm praying you won't say no
I mean to tell you

Don't let it end
Baby, we could have so much more
Don't let it end
Honey please don't walk out that door

I'm telling you baby I made my mistakes
But I'll make you this promise
To do what it takes
I'll be there to protect you
And hold you tight
You got my loving, baby, every single night
Don't let it end
I'm begging you....Don't let it end this way
Don't let it end
I'm begging you
Don't let it end this WAY

Don't let it end
Baby, we could have so much more
Don't let it end
Honey, please don't walk out that door
Don't let it end
I'm begging you
Don't let it end this way
Don't let it end
I'm begging you
Don't let it end this way

Oh no no
Oh no no

What will I do?
If you say we're through
I need you to stay
Honey, Don't let it end this way
