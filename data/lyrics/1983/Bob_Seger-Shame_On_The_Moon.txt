Until you've been beside a man
You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't

When nothin' comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

Once inside a woman's heart
A man must keep his head
Heaven opens up the door
Where angels fear to tread

Some men go crazy
Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

Everywhere it's all around
Comfort in a crowd
Strangers faces all around
Laughin' right out loud

Hey watch where you're goin'
Step light on old toes
'Cause until you've been beside a man
You don't know who he knows

Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon
Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Blame it on midnight
You can blame it on midnight
Shame, shame, shame, shame on the moon
You can blame it on midnight
Shame on the moon

Blame it on the moon
