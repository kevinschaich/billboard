CHORUS: Workin' in a coalmine
Goin' down, down, down
Workin' in a coalmine (woop!)
About to slip down
Workin' in a coalmine
Goin' down, down, down
Workin' in a coalmine (woop!)
About to slip down
5 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm already up and gone
Lord, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?



'Cause I make a lil' money
Hauling gold by the ton
But when Saturday rolls around
I'm too tired for having fun (too tired for havin')



Lord, I'm so tired!
How long can this go on?



5 o'clock in the morning
I'm already up and gone
Lord, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?



5 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm already up and gone
Lord, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?



'Cause I make a lil' money
Hauling gold by the ton
But when Saturday rolls around
I'm too tired for having fun (too tired for havin')



(Lord, I'm so tired!)
