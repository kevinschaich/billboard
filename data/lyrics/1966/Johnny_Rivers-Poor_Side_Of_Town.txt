Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be

How can you tell me
How much you miss me
When the last time I saw you
You wouldn't even kiss me

That rich guy you've been seein'
Must have put you down
So welcome back baby
To the poor side of town

To him you were nothin'
But a little plaything (was a plaything, doo wah)
Not much more than
An overnight fling (overnight fling, doo wah)

To me you were the greatest thing
This boy had ever found
And girl it's hard to find nice things
On the poor side of town

I can't blame you for tryin'
I'm tryin' to make it too
I've got one little hang up, baby
I just can't make it without you (without you, without you)

So tell me
Are you gonna stay now (will you stay now, doo wah)
Will you stand by me girl
All the way now (all the way now, doo wah)

With you by my side
They can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town

(So tell me how much you love me)
(Come be near to me and say you need me now)

Oh, with you by my side
This world can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town

Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
