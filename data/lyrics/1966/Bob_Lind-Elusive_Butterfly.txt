You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned
It will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name as I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me running
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing

Don't be concerned
It will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
