From the time I fall asleep
'Til the morning comes I dream about
You baby
And I feel all right
'Cause I know tonight I'll be with
You baby
And who makes me feel like smiling
When the weary day is through

You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you

They say candy is sweet
But it just can't compete with
You baby
You've got everything I need
And nobody can please like
You do, baby
And who believes all my wildest dreams
And my craziest schemes will come true

You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you

A little ray of sunshine
A little bit of soul
Add just a touch of magic  
You got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll

You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you
