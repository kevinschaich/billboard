Dandy, Dandy
Where you gonna go now?
Who you gonna run to?
All your little life
You're chasin' all the girls
They can't resist your smile
Uh-hmm, they long for

Dandy, Dandy
Chattin' up the ladies
Ticklin' their fancy
Pourin' out your charms
To meet your own demands
And you turn it off at will
Huh-oh, they long for

Dandy, Dandy
Knockin' on the back door
Climbin' through the window
Hubby's gone away
And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play
Uh-hmm, you low-down

Dandy, Dandy, Dandy

Dandy, you know you're moving much too fast
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past
Look around you and see the people settle down
And when you're old and grey
You will remember what they said
That two girls are too many
Three's a crowd and four you're dead

Oh Dandy, Dandy
When you gonna give up?
Are you feelin' old now?
You always will be free
And you need no sympathy
A bachelor you will stay
And Dandy you're all right
You're all right
You're all right
You're all right
You're all right
