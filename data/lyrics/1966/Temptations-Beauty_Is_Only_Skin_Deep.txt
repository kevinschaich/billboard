So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness

A pretty face may be
Some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, oh baby, oh yeah, oh yeah

Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah

My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality

Now show me a girl
A girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one
With true lovin' every time

Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

So if you're lookin' for a lover
Don't judge a book by its cover
She may be fine on the outside
But so untrue on the inside

Beauty's only skin deep
