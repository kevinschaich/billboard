Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be be there by 4:30
'Cause I've made your reservation

Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together
Till the morning brings my train

And I must go
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Take the last train to Clarksville
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee flavored kisses
And a bit of conversation

Oh
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this noisy
Railroad station all alone

I'm feelin' low
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Ah
(Ah)

Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be be there by 4:30
'Cause I've made your reservation

Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
