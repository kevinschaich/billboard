Girl you got this need to know what I'm all about
There was something that you dig you can't figure out
Now you want to know what moves my soul
And what dips inside of my brain
Well I got this need I just can't control
And it's driving me insane

I can't take it, ow, because I'm
Hungry for those good things baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life baby
With a real fine girl like you
I can almost taste it baby
And it's sweet as wine

There's a custom-tailored world that I want to own, someday
With a special place of hiding we can stay alone, you and me
Girl I'm gonna' have it all someday if you'll just hang on to my hand
If I break some rules along the way, you gotta' understand
It's my way of gettin' what I want now, 'cause I'm hungry

Well I ain't gonna' waste it now
When it's finally mine
Gonna' live each minute, bill the often days
'Til I've had my fill,  ah girl I'll be rollin' in it
Yes, yes you know I will, yes I will, wahhh!

I can't take it, ow, because I'm
Hungry for those good things baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life baby
With a real fine girl like you
I can almost taste it baby
And it's sweet as wine
