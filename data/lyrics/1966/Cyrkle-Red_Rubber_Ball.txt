I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only 
Starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining 
Like a red rubber ball

You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took 
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

Oh, I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
