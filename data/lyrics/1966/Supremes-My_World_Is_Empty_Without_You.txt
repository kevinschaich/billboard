My world is empty without you, baby
My world is empty without you, baby

And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strenght
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear
I miss so much

My world is empty without you, baby
My world is empty without you, baby

From this old world
I try to hide my face
From this loneliness
There's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories
I know so well

I need love know
More then before
I can hardly 
Carry on anymore

My world is emty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is emty) without you, babe

My mind and soul 
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist
And each time that darkness falls
It finds me alone
With these four walls

My world is emty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is emty) without you, babe

Without you, babe
Without you, babe
