You're the kind of person you meet at certain 
Dismal, dull affairs 
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud 
Running up and down the stairs 

Well, it seems to me that you have seen 
Too much in too few years 
And though you've tried, you just can't hide 
Your eyes are edged with tears 

You better stop and look around 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 

When you were a child, you were treated kind 
But you were never brought up right 
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys 
But still you cried all night 

Your mother who neglected you 
Owes a million dollars tax 
And your father's still perfecting ways 
Of making sealing wax 

You better stop and look around 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 

Oh, who's to blame? 
That girl's just insane 
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work 
It only seems to make matters worse, oh, please 

You were still in school when you had that fool 
Who really messed your mind 
And after that you turned your back 
On treating people kind 

On our first trip, I tried so hard 
To rearrange your mind 
But after a while, I realized you were 
Disarranging mine 

You better stop and look around 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here it comes, here it comes 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 

Oh, who's to blame? 
That girl's just insane 
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work 
It only seems to make matters worse, oh, please 

When you were a child, you were treated kind 
But you were never brought up right 
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys 
But still you cried all night 

Your mother who neglected you 
Owes a million dollars tax 
And your father's still perfecting ways 
Of making sealing wax 

You better stop and look around 
Here it comes 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown 
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
