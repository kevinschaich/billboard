And when I see the sign that, points one way
The lot we used to pass by, every day

Just walk away Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my, block are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the tears that, I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain that, I chose to hide

Just walk away Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down, upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Just walk away Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down, upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me, though they're so small

Just walk away Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my, block are not the same
You're not to blame
