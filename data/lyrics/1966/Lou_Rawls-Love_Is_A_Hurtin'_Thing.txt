For every little kiss there's a little teardrop
For every single thrill there's another heartache
The road is rough
The going gets tough

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When you're in my arms I'm a king on a throne
But when we're apart I walk the streets alone
One day happiness
The next day, loneliness

When love brings so much joy why must it bring such pain
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
I want you though I know that

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing
