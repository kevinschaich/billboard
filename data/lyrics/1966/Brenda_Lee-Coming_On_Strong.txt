Comin' on strong, comin' on strong.
I can feel the heartaches
Comin' on strong.
I can feel the teardrops, the pain, and the sorrow
Ever since you've been gone, they' been
Comin' on strong.

Pain, come on in, hello sorrow,
I see you're back again.
Teardrops, glad you dropped by,
'Cause you can help drown my pride.

And since you're here, time seems just fine,
To let you know that you're gonna be with me
'Til I lose my mind,
But you've been gone,
Much too long and I can feel the heartaches,
Comin' on strong.

Only thing you left me, was misery for company,
And memories of a love gone wrong, that keep
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
