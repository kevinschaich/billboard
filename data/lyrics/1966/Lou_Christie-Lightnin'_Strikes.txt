Listen to me, baby, you gotta understand
You're old enough to know the makings of a man
Listen to me, baby, it's hard to settle down
Am I asking too much for you to stick around?

Every boy wants a girl
He can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you
Won't you wait?
But till then

When I see lips beggin' to be kissed (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)

Lightning's striking again
Lightning's striking again

Nature's takin' over my one-track mind
Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time
All the girls are sayin' that you'll end up a fool
For the time being, baby, live by my rules

When I settle down
I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget
And I'll make up
For all lost time

If she's put together fine and she's readin' my mind (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)

Lightning's striking again
Lightning's striking me again and again and again and again

Lightning's striking again
Lightning's striking again

There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture in your mind
Love forever
But till then

If she gives me a sign that she wants to make time (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)

Lightning's striking again
Oh, lightning is striking again and again and again and again and
Lightning's striking again and again and again and again
