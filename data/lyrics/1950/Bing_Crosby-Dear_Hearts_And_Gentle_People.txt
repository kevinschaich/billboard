i love those dear hearts and gentle people
who live in my home town
because those dear hearts and gentle people
will never ever let you down

they read the good book 
from fri till monday
that's how the weekend goes
i've got a dream house
i'll build there one day
with picket fence and ramblin rows

i feel so welcome each time i return
that my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
i love the dear hearts and gentle people
who live and love in my home town

there's a place i'd like to go 
and it's back in idaho
where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello
it's a pleasure and a treat 
to meandor down the street 
that's why i want the whole wide world to know
i love those dear hearts 
i love the gentle people
(who live in my home town)
because those dear hearts and gentle people 
will never ever let you down

they read the good book 
from fri till monday
that's how the weekend goes
i've got a dream house
i'll build there one day
with picket fence and ramblin rows

i feel so welcome each time i return
that my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
i love the dear hearts and gentle people
who live and love in my home town

(home home sweet home
home home sweet home)
home home sweet home
home home sweet home
