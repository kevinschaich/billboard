Put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I want is having you
And music, music, music

I'd do anything for you
Anything you'd want me to
All I want is kissing you
And music, music, music

Closer
My dear, come closer
The nicest part of any melody
Is when you're danciong close to me

So, put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I want is loving you
And music, music, music

Put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I want is having you
And music, music, music

I'd do anything for you
Anything you'd want me to
All I want is kissing you
And music, music, music

Closer
My dear, come closer
The nicest part of any melody
Is when you're danciong close to me

So, put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I want is loving you
And music, music, music

C'mon everybody
Put some nickels in
And keep that old nickelodeon playing
Music, music, music

Lum, dee, dum, dee, da dee dum
