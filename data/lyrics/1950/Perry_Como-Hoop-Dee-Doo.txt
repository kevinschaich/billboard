Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
I hear a polka an' my troubles are through!  
Hoop dee doo, hoop dee dee,  
this kind of music is like heaven to me!  

Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
it's got me higher than a kite,  
hand me down my soup an' fish  
I am gonna get my wish, hoop dee doin' it tonight!  

When there's a trombone playin'  
I get a thrill, I always will!  
When there's a concertina, stretched about a  mile,  
I always smile, 'cause that's my style! 

When there's a fiddle in the middle  
oh! it really is a riddle, how he plays a tune so sweet!  
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die,  
lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more  
'cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy! 

Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) 
I hear a polka an' my troubles are through! ( Ha, ha, ha ha! ) 
Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee dee ( Hoop dee dee! ) 
this kind of music is like heaven to me!  

Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) 
it's got me higher than a kite,  


hand me down my soup an' fish  
I am gonna get my wish, hoop dee doin' it tonight!  

When there's a trombone playin'  
He gets a thrill! I get a thrill, I always will! He always will! 
When there's a concertina . . . stretched about a  mile,  
I always smile ( You'll see him smile! ) 'cause that's my style! ( 'Cause that's his style! ) 

When there's a fiddle in the middle  
oh! it really is a riddle, how he plays a tune so sweet!  
Plays a tune so sweet that we could die! 
Oh yes! . . . lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more  
'cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy! 

 

Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
it's got us higher than a kite,  
we're in clover, we're in bloom  
when we're dancin' give us room  
hoop dee doin' it with all of our might,  
rain may fall an' snow may come  
nothin's gonna stop us from 
hoop dee doin' it, hoop dee doin' it,  
hoop dee doin' it . . . tonight!
