There's no tomorrow when love is new
Now is forever when love is true
So kiss me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow, there's just tonight

Love is a flower that blooms so tender
Each kiss a dew drop of sweet surrender
Love is a moment of life enchanting
Let's take that moment, that tonight is granting

There's no tomorrow when love is new
Now is forever when love is true
So kiss me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow, there's just tonight
