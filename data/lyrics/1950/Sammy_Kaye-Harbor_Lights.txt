I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me

I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But I was on the ship
And you were on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But I was on the ship
And you were on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me
