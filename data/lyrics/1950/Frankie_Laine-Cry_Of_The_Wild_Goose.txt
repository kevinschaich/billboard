My heart knows what the wild goose knows,
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest? 

Tonight I heard the wild goose cry,
Wingin' north in the lonely sky.
Tried to sleep, it weren't no use,
'Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose, 

(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?) 

Woman was kind and true to me.
She thinks she loves me, the more fool she.
She's got a love that ain't no use,
To love a brother of the old wild goose. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?)
(Oh, you wild goose.) 

The cabin is warm and the snow is deep,
I got a woman who lies asleep.
She'll wake at tomorrow's dawn,
She'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone.
(Oh, you wild goose.) 

My heart knows what the wild goose knows,
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?
Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly away. 

Spring is comin' and the ice will break,
I can't linger for a woman's sake.
She'll see a shadow pass overhead.
She'll find my feathers beside my bed. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest? 

(Wild goose, wild goose, wild goose, wild goose.)
