Ya'll Know What This Is.

Only thing that keeps me up
When I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you
But I gotta keep mines around
'Cause I done looked I done searched
& it's hard to find
Another Shorty Like Mine
Baby yes I'm
Addicted to how we kick it...
(This is goin' after all the shorties around the world.)
Everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked
Hopin' that you stay with me
You search around the world
But you will never find
Another Shorty Like Mine
Shorty Like Mine.

I tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Stay kitted hood with It like mine
Mean walk talk the talk let me tell you some mo'.

I knew that when I ran into this one she would be the red rum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one to make me stop carin' about other girls in my jock & gettin' 'em
She was the one to slow me down hold me down I roll with her now
I go with her now I'm a grow with her I'm a go get her that's how, I got her.
Don't be mad you can't get one hotter
Broke them up when they made little mama
I don't care what my niggas say
She been there anyday for my drama
Some of the homies hate cause they want her wish they the one's that was datin' my woman
Go on get a good look cause she fine
& I don't mind 'cause she's mine.

I want to give her the world & I ain't never tryin' to lose her
I'm addicted to my girl & the way she twirls in that little skirt
Just for me in the club, in the crib in the streets
She reps for L.B. Dub E.N.T.
She have nice size with them pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a win it with the right prize & I'm gonna give it to her
To the rhythm of a high hat, she got a beautiful mind you can't buy that
& the sight from behind when she walk on by
Make a nigga wanna try that
She got the prettiest smile & she gangsta
Keep me from runnin' wild & I thank her
& we can talk about anything she got good conversation
My homey little friend & plus she patient.
