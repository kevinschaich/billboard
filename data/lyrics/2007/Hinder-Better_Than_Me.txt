I think you can do much better than me 
After all the lies that I made you believe 
Guilt kicks in and I start to see 
The edge of the bed 
Where your nightgown used to be 
I told myself I won't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

While looking through your old box of notes 
I found those pictures i took 
That you were looking for 
If there's one memory I don't want to lose 
That time at the mall 
You and me in the dressing room 
I told myself I won't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you 

I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder 
Wish I never would've said it's over 
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older 
Cause we never really had our closure 
This can't be the end 

I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 
(And I think you should know this) 
(You deserve much better than me)
