I am an arms dealer 
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words 
And I don't really care which side wins 
As long as the room keeps singing 
That's just the business I'm in     

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress 

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate

I wrote the gospel on giving up 
(You look pretty sinking) 
But the real bombshells have already sunk  
(Prima donnas of the gutter) 
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep 
Crashing not like hips or cars
No, more like p-p-p-parties 

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
Bandwagon's full, please catch another 

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate

All the boys who the dance floor didn't love 
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough 
Sing until your lungs give out 

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Now you) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Wear out the groove) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Sing out loud) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Oh, oh) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate
Oh, so intricate
