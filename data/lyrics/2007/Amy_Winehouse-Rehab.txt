They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

The man said: "Why you think you're here?"
I said: "I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near"

He said: "I just think you're depressed"
this, me, yeah, baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, oooh, just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

And It's not just my pride
It's just 'till these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go
