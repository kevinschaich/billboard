(Convict)

Akon
Convict, music
And you know we up front

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, hoe sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say: "I don't talk, Dogg, unless you told on me", oh well

Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me then I'mma pick on you
D-o-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you

I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot 'fore the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life

Akon
I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me now what it's gon' be
Just another tease far as I can see

Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin')
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you), mmm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Akon
Girl, and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Lil' mully don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl
