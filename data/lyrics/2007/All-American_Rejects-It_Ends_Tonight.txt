Your subtleties they strangle me 
I can't explain myself at all 
And all the wants, and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all 

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening 
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

A falling star, at least I fall alone 
I can't explain what you can't explain 
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving 
Maybe it's best you leave me alone 
A weight is lifted on this evening 
I give the final blow 

When darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight 
Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight

Now I'm on my own side 
It's better than being on your side 
It's my fault when you're blind 
It's better that I see it through your eyes 

All these thoughts locked inside 
Now you're the first to know 

When darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends when darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight
Tonight, insight 
When darkness turns to light it ends tonight
