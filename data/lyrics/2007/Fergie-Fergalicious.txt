Fergalicious definition
Make them boys go loco
They want my treasure
So they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons

Fergalicious
(So delicious)
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses
(Mwah)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be linin down the block
Just to watch what I got
(Four, tres, two, uno)
