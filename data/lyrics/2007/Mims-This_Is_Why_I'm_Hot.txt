This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mil' sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say we lost it, so I'mma bring it back

I love the dirty dirty, 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit I watch 'em get it on the floor

And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it any day
Compton to Hollywood as soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low-low, I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi', people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my, my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another person, another drop
16 bars, 24 a pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got

I'm into drivin' cars, push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need, you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my homie Black, meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners, see my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women that you niggas never had

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean, the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say, "Yeah, I paid a guap."
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, "All aboard!"
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
