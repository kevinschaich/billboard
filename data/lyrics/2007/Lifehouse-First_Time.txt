We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide

Lookin' at you
Holdin' my breath
For once in my life
I'm scared to death
I'm takin' a chance
Letting you inside

We're feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says,
For the first time

Maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
Whene'er I'm alone
With you tonight
Like bein' in love with you
For the first time

The world that I see inside you
Waitin' to come to life
Waking me up to dreamin'
Reality in her eyes

Looking at you
Holdin' my breath
For once in my life
I'm scared to death
I'm takin' a chance
Letting you inside

We're feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says,
For the first time

Maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
Whene'er I'm alone
With you tonight
Like bein' in love with you
For the first time

We're crashing
Into the unknown
We're lost in this,
But it feels like home

Feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says,
For the first time

Well maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
Whene'er I'm alone
With you tonight
Like bein' in love with you,
For the first time

Like bein' in love, she says,
For the first time
Like bein' in love with you,
For the first time.
