Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Ohh...
