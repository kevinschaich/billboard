Goddamn, damn

She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down
I'm ballin', throwin' money around

She a workin girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money, money, she makin', makin'
Look at the way she shakin', shakin'
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it now
Don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
She knows just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

50 Cent and Justin Timberlake
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I show you where to meet her
On the late night till daylight, the club jumpin'
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want

Justin Timberlake
Lemme talk to ya
Baby, this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together - maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here? You got me saying

AYO
I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
AYO
I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, soo I got to give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, soo I got to give it to her

Timbaland
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you

50 Cent
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
Make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In her fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down
You know I like when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

Justin Timberlake
