Damn...
I mean I just keep thinkin' about you.
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on.
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
& I don't know.
But I'm a go ahead & talk about it.

Listen...


I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryin' to fix the situation that's at hand 
You still runnin' through my mind when I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me I'm on your mind? & I'm knowin' that it couldn't be 
'Cause you ain't called I ain't even appalled 
I still got alot of pain I ain't dealt with at all
I've been runnin' around with other chicks 
I'm single & they lovin' it 
I'm likin' it but I just want the one that I was in love with 
That's not the end of it I'm tryin' to let you know 
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryin' to let you know 
You got a hold of some kind of control of me 
I don't know what it is but I gotta get you gone from me 
I'm workin' at it & it ain't gettin' no better
Just tryin' to be like "Yeah, Forget It, Whatever"
Instead of starin' out this glass lookin' at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause...


When I'm with somebody all I think about is you, yeah
When I'm alone that's all I wanna do, yeah
I miss the smilin' faces in my sidekick 
Out of town visits all the time we spend together makes it hard to get you Outta My System.
& you know what you do to me, do to me 
You don't even understand damn
& you know what you do to me do to me 
It's so hard to get you Outta My System.


I'm too attached my heart won't let me fall back 
I got it bad that's what you can call that 
& when I see you in the streets that's the worst for me 
I used to love the little things you did that's what works for me 
It's too major I see you on my pager
Knowin' what your doin' where you at or "Can I see you later?"
The fellas tellin' me "Just let her go Bow."
Believe me I'm tryin' man I just don't know how 
I be in all the top spots even with the hot shots knowin' they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot 
That's not poppin' & my brain ain't stoppin' thinkin' who she with or where she goin' is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life 
This is my first time dealin' with this kind of fight 
It's every night & every flight & every time you in my sight 
Damn, this ain't even right 'cause...


When I'm with somebody all I think about is you, yeah
When I'm alone that's all I wanna do, yeah
I miss the smilin' faces on my sidekick 
Out of town visits all the time we spend together makes it hard to get you Outta My System.
Ohhh.
& you know what you do to me, do to me 
You don't even understand damn
& you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you Outta My System.


Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You've been runnin' through my mind all day.
Can you feel me?
I've been tryin' to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time that's what kills me.

Hard to get you out.
& you know what you do to me, do to me 
You don't even understand damn

It's so hard to get you Outta My System.


I remember everything that me & you talked about 
Me & you had a whole life planned out together 
& if I could I would turn back the heads of time 
& correct all my mistakes that I ever did...
But now I guess I gotta move on right?
It's still hard & I still love you to this day.
Peace.
