I'm staring out into the night, trying to hide the pain
I'm goin' to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm goin' home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm goin' home, well I'm goin' home

The miles are getting longer it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm goin' home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah

Well I'm goin' home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me

But these places and these faces are getting old
I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
