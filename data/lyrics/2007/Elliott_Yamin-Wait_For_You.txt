I never felt nothing in the world like this before 
Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door 
Why did you have to go? 
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone 

Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance 
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand 
And all my tears they keep runnin' down my face 
Why did you turn away? 

So why does your pride make you run and hide 
Are you that afraid of me? 
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside 
This is not how you want it to be 

So baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don't know what else I can do 
Don't tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life 

Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I'll wait for you 

Been a long time since you called me 
(How could you forget about me) 
You gotta be feeling crazy 
How can you walk away 
(When) Everything stays the same 
I just can't do it baby 

What will it take to make you come back 
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that 
Why can't you look at me? 
You're still in love with me 
Don't leave me crying 

Baby why can't we just start all over again 
Get it back to the way it was 
If you give me a chance I can love you right 
But you're telling me it won't be enough 

So baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don't know what else I can do 
Don't tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life 

Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I'll wait for you 

So why does your pride make you run and hide 
Are you that afraid of me? 
But I know it's a lie what you're keeping inside 
That is not how you want it to be 

Baby I will wait for you 
Baby I will wait for you 
If it's the last thing I do 

Baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don't know what else I can do 
Don't tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life 

Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I'll wait for you 
I'll be waiting...
