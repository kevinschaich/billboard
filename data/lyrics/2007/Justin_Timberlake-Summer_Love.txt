Ridin' in the drop top with the top down,
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl,
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right,
Come here, let me get your name, girl

Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like,
Let me pick your brain, girl,
And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame, girl,
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out,

Bet you we could we could have some fun, girl,
'Cause we can do it fast fast, slow, whichever way you wanna run, girl,
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings,
Do it how you want it done, girl,
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I,

I can't wait to fall in love with you,
You can't wait to fall in love with me,
This just can't be summer love, you'll see,
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Come on and let me show you 'round,
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun, girl,
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down,
Any way you want it done, girl,
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone

Rappin' till we see the sun, girl,
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one, girl,
Well I'm a freak yeah right, each and every night,
I know how to do it insane, girl

'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop,
Make you wanna say my name, girl,
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees,
Can't get you off my brain, girl,
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I,

I can't wait to fall in love with you,
You can't wait to fall in love with me,
This just can't be summer love, you'll see,
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you,
You can't wait to fall in love with me,
This just can't be summer love, you'll see,
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Summer's over for the both of us,
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love,
Don't give up on love,
You're the one I've been thinking of,
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one,

I can't wait to fall in love with you,
You can't wait to fall in love with me,
This just can't be summer love, you'll see,
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you,
You can't wait to fall in love with me,
This just can't be summer love, you'll see,
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)


Let me set the mood right,
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright,
Let me set the mood right,
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright,

Gotta set the mood right,
Let me make you feel alright,
I'm gonna set the mood right,
I promise baby you'll feel alright,

Just let me set the mood right,
Let me make you feel alright,
I'm gonna set the mood right,
And you will say my name tonight,
If I set the mood right,
Promise girl you'll feel alright,
If you let me set the mood right,
I'll make you feel so good tonight,

If it feels good to you then it'll feel good to me,
Let me set the mood right.
