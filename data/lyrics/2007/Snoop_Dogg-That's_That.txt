Yeah, that?s right, I like that
The royal ***** is clean Your Highness
Thank you, uh uh, Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like that's that ****
I'm in the back of the club blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that ****

In the spot where the girls go wild, dancing ***** bar style
I'm like that's that ****
Snoop Dizzle, hey! Your boy Kells, hey!
Let me hear you say that's that ****

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel gon? get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon? all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin? on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest

I must confess that in the Chi you so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test you ******* with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago let me get you to this real West

It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny ***** home, work that filling till it's gone

Get that home grown put that **** on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it T-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this **** crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone you might get this dog bone

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like that's that ****
I'm in the back of the club blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that ****

In the spot where the girls go wild, dancing ***** bar style
I'm like that's that ****
Snoop Dizzle, hey! Your boy Kells, hey!
Let me hear you say that's that ****

Dippin? low, Six-Four hundred spokes and ****** smoke
All these ladies on the floor ?cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your *** up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle, now make that **** fall

Not just one, but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that **** for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew? Bring 'em too
Come here let me take you through it, then once Kelly get into it

We can get this after party poppin' everybody
Got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you?re gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot

Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get *****
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that ****, Kells sing that song, c?mon

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like that's that ****
I'm in the back of the club blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that ****

In the spot where the girls go wild, dancing ***** bar style
I'm like that's that ****
Snoop Dizzle, hey! Your boy Kells, hey!
Let me hear you say that's that ****

So if you think you got the bomb, ****, holla at a playa
Holla at a playa, holla at a playa
And if you lookin' for some good ***, holla at a playa
Holla at a playa, holla at a playa

Girl if you ever in the 312, holla at a playa
Holla at a playa, holla at a playa
And if you're ever in the 213, holla at a playa
Holla at a playa, holla at a playa

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like that's that ****
I'm in the back of the club blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that ****

In the spot where the girls go wild, dancing ***** bar style
I'm like that's that ****
Snoop Dizzle, hey! Your boy Kells, hey!
Let me hear you say that's that ****
