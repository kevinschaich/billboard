JR! Sean Kingston!

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See it started at the park used to chill after dark
Oh when you took my heart that's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought that love lasts forever
(Lasts forever)

They say we too young to get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said that we couldn't last together
(Last together)

See it's very defined, you're one of a kind
But you mush up my mind, you have to get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

It was back in '99 watchin' movies all the time
Oh when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought that we was gonna see each other
(See each other)

And then I came out, mami moved me down south
Oh, I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be that she wasn't the girl for me
(Girl for me)

See it's very defined, you're one of a kind
But you mush up my mind, you have to get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

Now we're fussing and now we're fighting
Please tell me why I'm feeling slighted
And I don't know how to make it better
(Make it better)

You're dating other guys, you're telling me lies
Oh, I can't believe what I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind and I don't think it's clever
(Think it's clever)

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
Suicide
