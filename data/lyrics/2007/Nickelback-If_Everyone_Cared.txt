From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing, amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing, amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

I'm singin' amen, I
Amen, I, I'm alive
Amen, I, amen, I
Amen, I, I'm alive

And in the air the fire flies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing, amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing, amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died

When nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

(We'd see the day, we'd see the day) When nobody died
(We'd see the day, we'd see the day) When nobody died
(We'd see the day when nobody died)
