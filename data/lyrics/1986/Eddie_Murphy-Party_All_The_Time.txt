Girl I can't understand it, why you want to hurt me
After all of the things I've done for you
I buy you champagne, roses and put diamonds on your fingers
But still you hang out all night, what am I to do

My girl wants to party all the time,
party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time,
party all the time, she parties all the time
Whoooohooohoohoo (party all the time)
She likes to party all the time (party all the time)
Whoooohooohoohoo (party all the time)
She likes to party all the time (party all the time)

Girl I seen you at clubs, just hangin' out and dancing
You give your number to every man you see
You never come home at night because your out romancin'
I wish you'd bring some of your love home to me

But My girl wants to party all the time,
party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time,
party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time,

My girl wants to party all the time
