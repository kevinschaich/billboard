Tell me lawyer what to do 
I think I'm falling in love with you 
Defend me from the way I feel 

Won't you give me some advice 
On how to handle my private life 
I'm sure we can make a deal 

I confess I'm a fool for men
With a clever mind 
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine 

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

Your sense of justice I'll embrace 
But your defense don't help my case 
I'm deep in trouble with the law 

Something about authority 
Seems to bring out the bad in me 
Hey lawyer, gotta catch me when I fall 

Oh, they say that you match your wits
With the best of them 
But I know when I'm close you're just
Like the rest of them 

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

So put your books aside 
Loosen off the suit and tie 
Gotta open up your heart and let me in 
Open up your heart and let me in

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male

Ooh, a little reaction
I'm just using my female charm 
On a typical male, on a typical male

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male

All I want, little reaction
Just enough
