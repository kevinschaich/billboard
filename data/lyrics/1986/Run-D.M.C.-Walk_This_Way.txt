Now there's a backseat lover
That's always under cover
And I talked til my daddy say
"said ya ain't seen nothin till your down on a muffin,
and theres sure to be a change in ways"
Now there's a cheerleader
That's a real big pleaser
As far as I could reminisce
And the best thing lovin'
Was your sister and your cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

She starts swingin'
With the boys in school
And her feet was flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to..

Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith:
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Well just gimme a kiss
Oooh, a-like this!

Run-D.M.C.:
School girl sleezy with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt hangin' way up her knee
There were three young ladies in a school gym locker
And I find there were lookin' at D
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I miss
Then my next door neighbor
Had a daughter, had a favour
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this
