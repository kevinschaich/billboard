Oh
Yeah yeah, yeah

I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite

With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the key and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares, I hate to sleep alone
I need some company, a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby, uh-huh

Just like Ronnie sang
I said, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby, my darlin', uh, uh, oh, oh, oh

I feel a hunger
It's a hunger

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Be my little baby
Be my darling

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
