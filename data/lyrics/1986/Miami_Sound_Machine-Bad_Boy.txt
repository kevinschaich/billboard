Bad boy bad boy
Boys will be boys
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but trouble

Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me oh so right
My heart goes beat beat
Beat beat beat beat

Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but trouble

And when he drives me home
I feel so safe at night
He'll call me on the phone
It goes ring ring ring
Ring-a-ring ring

Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Boys will be boys
Bad boy bad boy
Always get so restless
Nothing but trouble
Leaving me feeling breathless
Nothing but trouble
