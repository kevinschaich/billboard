How do rumors get started, they're started by the jealous people and 
They get mad seein' somethin' they had and somebody else is holdin' 
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist 
These wicked women, ooh, they just persist 
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed 
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess 

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day 
I just need some time, some time to get away from 
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more 
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door 

Hear the one about Tina, some say she's much too loose 
That came straight from a guy who claims he's tastin' her juice 
Hear the one about Michael, some say he must be gay 
I try to argue, but they said if he was straight he wouldn't move that way 
Hear the one about Susan, some say she's just a tease 
In a camisole she's six feet tall, she'll knock you to your knees 

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day 
I just need some time, some time to get away from 
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more 
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door 

I can't go no place without somebody pointin' a finger 
I can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors I'm a dead ringer 
It seems from rumors I just can't get away 
I bet there'll even be rumors floatin' around on Judgment Day 
I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill 
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors, shoot to kill 

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day 
I just need some time, some time to get away from 
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more 
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door 

What's mine is mine, I ain't got time for rumors in my life 
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks, so please let me live my life 
What's mine is mine, I ain't got time for rumors in my life 
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks, so please let me live my life 
What's mine is mine, I ain't got time for rumors in my life 
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks, so please let me live my life
