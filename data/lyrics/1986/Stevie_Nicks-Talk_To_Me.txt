I can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see your expression when the phone rings
We both know
There's something happening here

There's no sense in dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now
There's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view

Do I seem all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, I've searched through all my cards
Well, isn't that enough?
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do

You can talk to me
You can talk to me, when you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me

Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear (tear, tear, tear)

Let the walls burn down
Set your secrets free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here

You can talk to me
Talk to me, when you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Well, I can see that expression when the phone rings
And I can see that we're thinkin' 'bout the same thing
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?

Well I can see you, baby (I can see you, baby)
Well I can see you, baby (I can see you, baby)
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can see
