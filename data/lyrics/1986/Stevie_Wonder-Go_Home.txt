Her parents said, girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home  

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word, my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
Go home baby, you better go home right now
Go home, little girl you better go home
