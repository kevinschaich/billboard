Boy, there's no one home tonight
The timing could be right
To forget the rules
We're out of school until tomorrow

Now, if only you would stay
There's so many games we'd play
Why should we pretend to be just friends
When we could be so much more

Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)

Words don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens when the lights go down
With your arms around me

Time to leave the world behind
Save it for another time
Cause I don't remember where I am
When you start to
Love me

Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)

Baby, baby love
Sweet and tasty
Baby, baby love

Boy, I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel when we are near each other
Under covers

Warm, I hold you close to me
You're protection, first degree
Cause I don't remember where I am
When you start to
Move me

Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Baby, baby, baby)
(Just call it)

Baby love
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, you are my)
You are my
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(Baby, you are my)

(Repeat to fade)
