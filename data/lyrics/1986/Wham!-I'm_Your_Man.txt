Call me good, call me bad
Call me anything you want to baby
But I know that you're sad
And I know I'll make you happy 
With the one thing that you never had

Baby I'm your man (Don't you know that?) 
Baby I'm your man (You bet)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me

So good, you're divine
Wanna take you, wanna make you
But they tell me it's a crime
Oh, everybody knows where the good people go
But where we're going baby, ain't no such word as no

Baby, I'm your man (Don't you know who I am?)
Baby, I'm your man (You know, you bet)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (uh-huh baby)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (take me home)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me

Come on baby, (ooh, take me home
Please don't leave me here to do it on my own)

First class information
I'll be your sexual inspiration
And with some stimulation
We can do it right

So why waste time with the other guys?
When you can have mine
I ain't askin' for no sacrifice
Baby our friends do not need to know
I've got a real nice place to go

Listen
I don't need you to care
I don't need you to understand, yeah
All I want is for you to be there
And when I'm turned on, if you want me
I'm your man
I'm your man

If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (Oh)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me

Now listen
If you're gonna do it - you know what I say?
If you're gonna do it don't throw it away
Don't throw it baby
Because

I'll be your boy, I'll be your man
I'll be the one who understands
I'll be your first, I'll be your last
I'll be the only one you ask
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy
I'll be the one who brings you joy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl
I'll take you halfway 'round the world

I'll make you rich, I'll make you poor
Just don't use the door

If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
