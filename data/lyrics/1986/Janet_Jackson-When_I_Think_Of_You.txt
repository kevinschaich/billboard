Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
Hee (so in love)
With you (so in love)
(So in love)

When I think of you (when I think of you)
When I think of you (when I think of you)
Bass

I'm so in love
I just think of you
If you're not around, I'm
When I think of you

 (So in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby, you (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)

Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah
Baby
