Hey, here is the story
Forget about troubles in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line

That's why
You need
Ooh, that's why
This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

Whoa, don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from what you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Pick it up and throw it into shape, ooh yeah

That's why
You need
Ooh, that's why
This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

This is what you need
I'll give you what you need
This is what you need
I'll give you what you need
I'll give you what you need

Hey you, won't you listen?
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm?
I'll take you where you really need to be, whoa

Whoa, what you need, what you need
I'll give it all, I'll give it all, I'll give it all
I'll take you, I'll take you
Where you want to be
That's right
