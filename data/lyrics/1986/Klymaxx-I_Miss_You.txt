VERSE ONE
Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you 
then I realized 
that it was just my mind 
playing tricks on me....

It seems colder lately at night
and I try to sleep with the lights on
Everytime the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...  

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I,  And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see 
I miss you and me........

VERSE TWO
Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
all the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I,And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see 
I miss you and me........

BRIDGE
I've got to gather my senses together (Gather)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now) 
be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me............
