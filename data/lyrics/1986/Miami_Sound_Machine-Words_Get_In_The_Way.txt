I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side,
the one you always try to hide from me.

But I know when you have something on your mind.
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time.
And before you break my heart in two,
There's something I've been trying to say to you.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes,
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry,
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you anymore.
And despite the fact it's hurting me,
I know the time has come to set you free.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes,
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry,
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

I'm trying to say "I love you"
But the words get in the way.
