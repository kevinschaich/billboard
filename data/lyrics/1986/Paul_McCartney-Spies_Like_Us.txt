Ooh ooh what do you do 
No one else can dance like you 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 
Hey hey what do you say 
Someone took your plans away 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Hey don't feel afraid 
Of an undercover aid 
There's no need to fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Spies like us 

We don't know the meaning of fear 
We play every minute by ear 
One for all and all for one 
Everybody's on the run 
Especially at this time of year 

Ooh ooh what do you do 
No one else can dance like you 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody got spies like us 

Hey hey what do you say 
No one else can look that way 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody got spies like us 

We get there by hook or by crook 
We don't do a thing by the book 
Never needed special clothes 
How we did it no one knows 
I guess we must have had what it took 

Ooh ooh, ooh 
Oh when things get tough 
(Oh when things get tough) 
Guys like us act rough 
(Guys like us act rough) 

Hey hey what do you say 
Someone took your plans away 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Spies like us
