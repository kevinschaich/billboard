When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in
Go for a pallet that's so nice and thin
Zip it on around while it's on the ground
Spread it out, lay it on down

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

You're afraid of the dark, baby, don't be shy
We'll talk about some lovin' while we look at the sky
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright
We'll tuck it in till it's clean out of sight

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Let's go out to Egypt 'cause it's in the plan
Sleep beside the pharaohs in the shifting sand
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag
