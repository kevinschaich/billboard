I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl, I know what to believe 

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up 

In your dream, it's overcast
Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up, shape up
You're living on dreamtime (you want to run away)
Whoa-whoa
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Want to run away, want to run away

I know
I say

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Shape up
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
You're living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime, it's hard to carry on, girl
