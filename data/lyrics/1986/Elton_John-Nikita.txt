Hey, Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know

Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh, Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Oh, Nikita you will never know, never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
