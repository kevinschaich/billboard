I took a backseat, a backhander, I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you, oh yeah
You gotta conscience, compassion, you got a way with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too

I don't have a purpose omission, I'm empty by definition
I got a lack girl that you'd love to be
You wanna diva a deduction, you wanna do what they do
Wanna do damage that you can undo

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment, I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You wanna message a confession, you wanna martyr me too
You wanna margin of error for two

Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer, an exception, I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew

In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
Wanna forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
This is a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
This is a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

A perfect way
A perfect way
I got a perfect way
