Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on 
Just running away
If we stay any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around 
Never let them shoot us down
Never, never, never
Never run away

Hey baby you know it's true
Why you bother lying
When you know that you want it to
Don't you dare deny me

Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, let me go

We can't go on 
Just running away
If we wait any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around 
Never let them shoot us down

Never, never (no), never
Never run away

Never, no never, never
Never run away

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, never
