Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe

Please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right, it's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice

Please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

Daddy daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love, we are in love

So please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh oh

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep

(Papa don't preach) Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby
(Papa don't preach) Ooh
(Papa don't preach) Don't you stop loving me, daddy
(Papa don't preach) I know I'm keeping my baby
