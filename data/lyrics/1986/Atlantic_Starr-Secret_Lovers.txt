(HER)
Here we are, just the two of us together
Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes
(HIM)
I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no
We can't leave a trace

(BOTH)
Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let go, no, no
'Cause we love each other so
Ooh ooh

(HER)
Sittin' at home, I do nothin' all day
But I think about you and hope that you're okay
Hopin' you'll call before anyone gets home
I wait anxiously alone by the phone
(HIM)
How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Livin' two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there or fall

CHORUS:
(BOTH)
Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
Tryin' so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let go
'Cause what we feel is, oh, so real
So real, so real

(BOTH)
You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves all of the time

(HIM)
In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
(HER)
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful so that no one will know

CHORUS
So real, so real
