Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Jungle life, I'm far away from nowhere
On my own like Tarzan Boy
Hide and seek, I play along while rushing 'cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon

Jungle life, I'm living in the open
Native beat that carries on
Burning bright, a fire that blows a signal to the sky
I sit and wonder, does the message get to you?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other
Chance tonight
Gimme the other, gimme the other
Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other world

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Jungle life, you're far away from nothing
It's all right, you won't miss home
Take a chance, leave everything behind you
Come and join me, won't be sorry
It's easy to survive

Jungle life, we're living in the open
All alone like Tarzan Boy
Hide and seek, we play along while rushing 'cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon

Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other
Chance tonight
Oh, yeah
Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other
Night to night
You won't play

Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other
Chance tonight
Oh, yeah
Night to night, night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other world

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
