Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash, venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

Does the crowd understand? 
Is it East versus West, or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

In the warriors code, there's no surrender 
Though his body says stop, his spirit cries never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
it's the  Paradox that drives us on

It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack, it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire
