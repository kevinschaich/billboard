What would you say if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Oh no, we could be both to each other

And yes, it's a chance that we're taking
Somebody's heart may be breaking
But we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

I've been through you and you've been through me
And sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
But we always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Oh no, we could be both to each other
