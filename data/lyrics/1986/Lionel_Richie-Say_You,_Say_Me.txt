Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand, someone who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say "I'll show you"

Say you, say me
Say it for always, oh
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always, aw
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

Say it together
Naturally
