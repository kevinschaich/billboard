Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this (all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
