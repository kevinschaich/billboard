Hey, hey you do
Hey you wanna do a job?

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back

All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Ha oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony, yeah (yeah)

Show me 'round your fruit cage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Yeah, you'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest

I'm gonna be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
Yeah, I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Sledge, sledge
Sledgehammer

I've kicked the habit (kicked the habit, kicked the habit)

Gonna feel that power build in you (show for me)
Come on, come on, help me do
Come on, come on, help me do (show for you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you (show for me)
