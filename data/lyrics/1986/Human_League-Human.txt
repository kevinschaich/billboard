Come on baby, dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never like to see you cry
Won't you please forgive me?

I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes

So many nights I longed to hold you
So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
(I am just a man)
(Human)
(Human)
Please forgive me 

The tears I cry aren't tears of pain
They're only to hide my guilt and shame
I forgive you, now I ask the same of you
While we were apart, I was human too

(Human)
(Human)

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
(I am just a man)
Human
Born to make mistakes

(Human, Human)
