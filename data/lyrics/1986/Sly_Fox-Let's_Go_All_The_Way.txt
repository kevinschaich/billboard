Sitting with the thinker
Just trying to work it out
It's a traffic jam of the brain
Makes you want to scream and shout

Presidential party
No one wants to dance
Looking for a new star
To put you in a trance

Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Let's go all the way

Workin' in a factory
Eight days a week
Tryin' to make dollar
Down what a beat

Cartoon capers
Happen in reality
Rich man poor man
Livin' in fantasy

Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
(Ohh ohh ohh)
Let's go all the way

(Yeah yeah yeah)

Livin' in New York
Looks like an apple core (apple core)
Asphalt jungle
Got to be a man-of-war

California dreamers
Sinkin' in the sand (the sand the sand)
The Hollywood squares are
Living in Disneyland

(Wheee ahhhhhh)
Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
(Ahh ahh ahh)
Let's go all the way

Let's go all the way

Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
We need heaven on earth today
(Ahh ahh ahhhh)
We can make a better way

Let's go all the way

Go all the way

Let's go all the way
(Yeah)

Na na na na 
Na na na na
