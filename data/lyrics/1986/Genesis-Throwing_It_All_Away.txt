Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions
Are something we don't share?

I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to deceive you
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Everytime that I look at you
I can see the future
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?

I watch the world go 'round and 'round
And see mine turnin' upside down

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
We're throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Just a throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Just a-throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
