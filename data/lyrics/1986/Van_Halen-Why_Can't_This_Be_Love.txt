Whoa, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch

Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much, hey

And I can't recall
Any love at all
Ah baby, this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
And only time will tell
If we stand the test of time

All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line, hey

No, I can't recall
Anything at all
Oh, baby this blows 'em all away
Wooh

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

Wooh
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

Baby, why can't this be love?
Got to know why can't this be love?
I wanna know why can't this be love?
