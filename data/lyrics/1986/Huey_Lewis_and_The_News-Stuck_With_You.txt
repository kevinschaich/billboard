We've had some fun
Yes, we've had our ups and downs 
Been down that rocky road
But here we are, still around

We thought about someone else
But neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up
Now we know it's much too late

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you 
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We've had our doubts (ooh, wa ooh)
We never took them seriously
And we've had our ins and outs (ooh, wa ooh)
But that's the way it's supposed to be

We thought about giving up (giving up)
But we could never stay away
We thought about breaking up (ooh, wa ooh)
But now we know it's much too late

And it's no great mystery
If we change our minds
Eventually
It's back to you and me

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you 
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

(Yes, it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh, wa ooh) I'm happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh, wa ooh) Happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh, yes it's true)
