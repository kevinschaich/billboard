So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love (in love)
Now here I stand
I wonder why, ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own) This wasn't how it was supposed to end
(On my own) I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

On my own (This wasn't how it was supposed to end)
On my own (I wish that we could do it all again)
On my own (I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone)
By myself

So many times
I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life

I don't want to live without you
On my own
On my own
On my own

This wasn't how it was supposed to end
I wish that we could do it all again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
On my own, I've got to find where I belong again

I've got to learn how to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself by myself

I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's my time again
And I have faith that I will shine again

I have faith in me
On my own
On my own
On my own
