Oh, whoa, whoa
Ow
Mm!

There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said-ah, hey, what is this?
Now  baby, maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss

I said-ah, "Hey, what's your name baby?
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate."
Ow!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Mm!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Whoa, ooh

Let me tell you now
Mm!

I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"

I said, "Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Huh, now you're trying to trick me in love"
Ow!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now

Yeah, it's all right now
Yeah!

Hoo!
Oh yeah, ow!
Let me tell you all about it, now
Ow!
Yeah

Took her home, yeah, to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, uh, what's your game?
Are you trying to put me in shame?"

"Baby," I said, "Slow, slow, don't go so fast, huh
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Now he's trying to trick me in love"
Yeah!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now, yeah
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now

All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
All right now
All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
