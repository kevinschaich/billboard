Children play in the park
They don't know
I'm alone in the dark
Even though

Time and time again
I see your face smiling inside

I'm so happy (Oho)
that you love me (Oho, yeah)
Life is lovely (Oh)
When you're near me

Tell me you will stay
Make me smile

Living life is just a game
So they say
All the games we used to play
Fade away

We may now enjoy
The dreams we shared so long ago

Oh, my darling (Oho)
Got to have you (Yeah, yeah)
Feel the magic (Ooohooo!)
When I hold you

Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky

Now I need you (Oh, yeah)
More than ever (Oh, yeah)
No more crying (Ooohooo)
We're together

Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
