If I could be you 
And you could be me 
For just one hour
If we could find a way 
To get inside 
Each other's mind, mmm
If you could see you
Through your eyes 
Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be 
Surprised to see 
That you'd been blind, mmm

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now your whole world 
You see around you 
Is just a reflection
And the law of karma
Says you're gonna reap 
Just what you sow, yes you will
So unless 
You've lived a life of 
Total perfection
You'd better be careful 
Of every stone 
That you should throw, yeah

And yet we spend the day 
Throwing stones 
At one another
'Cause I don't think
Or wear my hair 
The same way you do, mmm
Well I may be 
Common people 
But I'm your brother
And when you strike out 
And try to hurt me 
It's a-hurtin' you, lord have mercy

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

There are people 
On reservations 
And out in the ghettos
And brother there 
But for the grace of God 
Go you and I, yeah, yeah
If I only 
Had the wings 
Of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly 
To the top of the mountain
And then I'd cry

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Better walk a mile in my shoes

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Uh, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes, yeah

Walk a mile in my shoes
