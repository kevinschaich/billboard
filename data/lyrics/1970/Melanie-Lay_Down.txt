Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown 
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown 

We  were so close, there was no room 
We bled inside each other's wounds 
We  all had caught the same disease 
And we all sang the songs of peace  

Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown 
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown 

So raise the candles high 
'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the night 
Oh, raise them higher again 
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain 

Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown  

We were so close, there was no room 
We bled inside each other's wounds 
We all had caught the same disease 
And we all sang the songs of peace 
Some came to sing, some came to pray 
Some came to keep the dark away 

So raise the candles high 
'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the sky
Oh, raise them higher again 
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain 

Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown 

Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown
You got to lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown 

You got to lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown 
Oh, lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown

Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down 
Let your white birds smile up 
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down  
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
