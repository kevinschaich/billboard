A-that girl
I'm gonna make her mine if it takes all night
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it

A-that girl
I'm gonna make her mine if it takes all night
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it

Good evening, sweet darling
May I ask your name
You seem to be lonely
Well, don't worry, I'm feeling the same

Whoa, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet at a time like this
Whoa, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that I just can't miss

A-that girl
I'm gonna make her mine if it takes all night
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it

A-that girl
I'm gonna make her mine if it takes all night
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it

It's been a long time, sweet darling
Since love has come my way
But I'm trying so hard
To find the right words to say

Whoa, it's a groovy situation
And a splendid combination
That we should meet at a time like this
Whoa, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that I just can't miss

Whoa, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet at a time like a-this
Whoa, it's a groovy situation
And a splendid combination
You're something that I just can't miss

Baby, baby, it's a groovy situation
And a splendid combination
That we should meet at a time like a-this
Whoa, it's a groovy situation
And a splendid combination
You're something that I just can't miss

Baby, baby, it's a groovy situation
