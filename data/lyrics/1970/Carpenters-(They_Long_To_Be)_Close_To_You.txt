Why do birds suddenly appear
Everytime you are near?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Everytime you walk by?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Just like me (Just like me) they long to be
Close to you

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
