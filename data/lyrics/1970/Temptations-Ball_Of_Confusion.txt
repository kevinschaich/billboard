People moving out
People moving in
Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on

Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation
Obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on

Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say, "More taxes will solve everything,"
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows

Oh, Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on

Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war!"
And the band played on

Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a Ball Of Confusion
