(Police sirens)

REFRAIN
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
I wish I had you, to talk to

If a man ever needed dying he did
No one had a right to say what he said about you
And it's so cold and lonely here without you
Out there the law is coming
I've been so tired of running

REFRAIN

It hurts to see the man that I've become
To know I'll never see the morning sunshine on the land
I'll never see your smiling face or touch your hand
If just once more I could see
You, our home and our little baby

REFRAIN

I hope this letter finds it's way to you
Forgive me love for the shame I've put you through and all the tears
Hang on love to the memories of those happy years
Red lights are flashing around me
Good Lord it looks like they found me

REFRAIN

(Repeat line "Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there" over
And over with background of "This is the police. You are surrounded
Give yourself up." and fade)
