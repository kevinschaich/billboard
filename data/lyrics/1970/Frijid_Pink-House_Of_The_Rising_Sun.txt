There is a house in New Orleans,
They call the rising sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor Boy,
And God I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor,
Sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man.
Down in New Orleans.
Now the only thing a gambler needs is
A suitcase and a trunk.
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk.

Oh mother, tell your children,
Not to do what I have done.
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Well I've got one foot on the platform 
The other foot on the train 
I'm going back to New Orleans 
To wear that ball and chain 

Well there is a house in New Orleans 
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know, I'm one
