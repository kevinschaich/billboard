Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night
Oh-oh-oh, I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days

Don't be afraid
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be (Where we can be) 
(Where we can be) Closer to heaven
(To heaven, stay)

Stay with me
And we shall let expression sing
Can't you hear 'em ring?
Oh-oh-oh, memories of yesterday
Yesterday's broken dreams
Don’t you know, they'll all fade away

If you'll come
Up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be (Where we can be)
(Where we can be) Oh, closer to heaven

We'll laugh and I'll tell you the story of love
How it is, and the happiness in it, baby
We'll combine our thoughts
And together we'll travel the roads
To the fountain of loveliness
I will never, ever, ever leave you
Leave you alone to wonder
As we go on, our love, it will grow (It will grow)
Much stronger and stronger

Don't you wanna go
Up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be closer to heaven

Ah, up the (Up the)
Ooh-ooh, up the (Up the)
Oh, come on and walk (Walk)
Come on and talk (Talk)
Come on and sing about love and understanding
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Up the ladder to the roof)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (See heaven)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Go up the ladder to the roof)
