Ma belle amie
You were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie
Apres tous les beaux jours, je te dis merci, merci
You were the answer on all my questions, before we're through
I want to tell you that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by  leaving me now and start anew
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with  you

Let the bells ring, let the birds sing
Let's all give my substitute a big cheer
Let the bells ring, let the birds sing
For the man after him waits here
For the man after him waits here

Ma belle amie
You were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie
There was a time that you thought that your only friend was me
You were the answer on all my questions, before we're through
I want to tell you that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by leaving me now and start anew
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you

Let the bells ring, let the birds sing
Let's all give my substitute a big cheer
Let the bells ring, let the birds sing
For the man after him waits here
For the man after him waits here
