Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting 
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers 
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young 
My heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me 
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's 
The thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again 
Should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird
Take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes 
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

Yeah, if I could I know that I would 
Fl-y-y-y-y away with you
