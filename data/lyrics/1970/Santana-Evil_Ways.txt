You've got to change your evil ways, baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change, baby
And every word that I say is true

You've got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You've got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on
Lord knows you've got to change, baby
Baby

When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You hang around, baby
With Jean and Joan and a-who knows who

I'm gettin' tired of waiting and fooling around
I'll find somebody that won't make me feel like a clown 
This can't go on
Lord knows you've got to change

Hey

When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You hang around, baby
With Jean and Joan and a-who knows who

I'm gettin' tired of waiting and fooling around
I'll find somebody that won't make me feel like a clown 
This can't go on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
