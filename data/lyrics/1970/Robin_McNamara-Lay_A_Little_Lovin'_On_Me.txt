Can't you see that I am all for your love
Now, now
Can't you see
Can't you see
How much I need some more love
Baby
Can't you see
Can't you see
Ever since we kissed that night
Ever since I held you tight
I just don't want nobody else
So put your lips on mine
Leave them there 'til the morning time
Lord don't leave me by myself

Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me
You're gonna want me babe
Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me

Everyday is not enough of your love
Everyday
I need the day and every nighttime too
Everyday
Everyday
Don't you know what I've got inside
A love that's been denied
A love that's growing day by day
You're such a pretty child
You're about to drive me wild
Come on babe
Now what you say

Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
You're gonna want me Babe
So lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me

Honey I want you
Baby I need you
I love you
I love you

Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
You're gonna want me babe
So lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
So lay a little lovin' on me...
