You know I got to show you
Nobody else before you
Ever gave me  such
A beautiful feeling

Oh, woman, you
Touched a-my  soul now
Honey, don't you let go now
Hold on, baby
Just a  little bit tighter

Hold on
Just a little  bit tighter now, baby
I love you so much and
I can't let go, no no  no
Hold on, a just a little bit
Tighter now,  baby

Love is so surprising
Opened up my eyes  and
You reached out and
Took my hand

Baby, you  touched a-my soul now
Woman, don't let go now
Hold on,  baby
Just a little bit tighter

Hold on
Just a little  bit tighter now, baby
I love you so much and
I can't let go, no no no
Hold on, a just a little bit
Tighter now, baby

Oh,  woman, you
Touched a-my soul now
Honey, don't you let go now
Hold on, baby
Just a little bit tighter
