Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

Life's too short to make a mistake
Let's think of each other and hesitate
Young and impatient we may be
There's no need to act foolishly
If we part, our hearts won't forget it
Years from now we'll surely regret it

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

You're young and you're in a hurry
You're eager for love, but don't you worry
We both want the sweetness in life
But these things don't come overnight
Don't give up 'cause love's been slow
Girl, we gonna succeed with another blow

Just give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Baby, please, baby
Baby, please, baby

Love is that mountain we must climb
Let's climb it together, your hand in mine
We haven't known each other too long
But the feeling I have is oh so strong
I know we can make it, there's no doubt
We owe it to ourselves to find it out

Just give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow, brr
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Baby, please, baby
Baby, please, baby
