You lie in gentle sleep beside me
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing
I take your hand and hold it tightly
Listen, can you not hear our young hearts beating

I kiss the sleep from your eyes
Your smile is sweeter than the morning
And a-here it comes

Can't you feel it, baby
Can't you feel it, here it comes
Feel it, feel it
Fire, fire
Something's burning
Something's burning
Something's burning 
And I think it's love

And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever

I cup my hands to touch your face
And once again I feel your fire
And a-here it comes

Can't you feel it, baby
Can't you feel it, here it comes again
Feel it, feel it
Fire, fire
Something's burning
Something's burning
Something's burning 
And I think it's love

And I think it's love
And I think it's love
And I think it's love

Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
And I think it's love 

And I think it's love 
Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
Can't you feel the fire 
Keeps burnin' 
And I think it's love 
And I think it's love
