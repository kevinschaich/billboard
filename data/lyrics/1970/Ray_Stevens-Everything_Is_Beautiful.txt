Jesus loves the little children
All the children of the world
Pretty yellow black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Everything is beautiful
In it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

There is none so blind
As he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thoughts be free

For every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that people lies
In the eyes of the beholder

And everything is beautiful
In it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, ah sing it children

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care about the length of his hair
Of the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within

We're gonna get old again now
Everything is gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the calm good side my friend
And spittle in out in your mind

And everything is beautiful
In it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, ah sing it children

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way, one more time

Everything is beautiful
In it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day
