I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle,
With a trace of misty morning,
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes...

And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh...

This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay...
For more than just a day

I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove...

And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love...

This time the girl is gonna stay (This time the girl is gonna stay)
This time the girl is gonna stay...
For more than just a day

For more than just a day...
(I just can't help believing...)
