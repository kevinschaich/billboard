If you want it, here it is come and get it
Mmmm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

If you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast

If you want it, here it is come and get it

But you better hurry 'cause it may not last

Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Fool and his money

Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
