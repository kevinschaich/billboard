A buh-buh buh buh-buh
(A buh-buh buh buh-buh)

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like I before E except after C
And why two plus two makes four

Now now now, I'm gonna teach you (teach you, teach you)
All about love, dear (all about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

ABC, easy as 123
As simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me girl

ABC, easy as 123
As simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me girl

Come on, let me love you just a little bit
Come on, let me love you just a little bit
I'm a going to teach how to sing it out
Come on, come one, come on
Let me show you what it's all about

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, girl
Your education ain't complete

T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you (show you, show you)
How to get an A
Spell "me" "you", add the two
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do

ABC, easy as 123
As simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me girl

ABC, easy as 123
As simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me

Sit down, girl
I think I love you
No, get up, girl
Show me what you can do

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooo oooh
Shake it shake it, baby, huh
123, baby, oo ooh
ABC, baby, nah nah!
Do re mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be

123, baby
ABC, baby
Do re mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

It's easy, it's easy like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
I'm a gonna teach you how to sing it loud
Come on, come on, come on
Lemme show you what it's all about

ABC, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
I'm a gonna teach you how to sing it loud
Sing it loud, sing it, go, sing it, go sing it
ABC, it's easy as 123
