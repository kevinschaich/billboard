Oh, darling
I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night
Always thinking about you

But if I had the
Chance to start all over
I would be wishing today
On a four leaf clover

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Oh, darling
I can't hold out much longer
For the pain is getting deep
Oh, the hurt keeps getting stronger

But if I had just one more try
I would be yours alone
Until the day I die

And we would
Have a love so divine
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Remember, girl
That I love you

Oh, darling, please
Please let me come back home
Your love has been
So good to me, baby
And I just realized
Without it, I can't go on

Cause you're the other half
That makes my life complete
If I had one more chance
We'd have a love so sweet

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time) I love you

(If I could turn back
The hands of time)
Girl, I need you
(If I could turn back
The hands of time) mmm

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)
