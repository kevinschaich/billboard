So long, boy, you can take my place
I got my papers, I got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River

Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come
I'm goin' back to the place that I love
Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love

Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleepin' underneath the moon
At Yellow River

Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time from
Yellow River

I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love

Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleepin' underneath the moon
At Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love
