I got a pocket full of quarters, and I'm headed to the arcade
I don't have a lot of money, but I'm bringing ev'rything I made
I've got a callus on my finger, and my shoulder's hurting too
I'm gonna eat them all up, just as soon as they turn blue

'Cause I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
It's driving me crazy
(Driving me crazy)
I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
I'm going out of my mind
(Going out of my mind)
I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
I'm going out of my mind
(Going out of my mind)

I've got all the patterns down, up until the ninth key
I've got Speedy on my tail, and I know it's either him or me
So I'm heading out the back door and in the other side
Gonna eat the cherries up and take them all for a ride

'Cause I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
It's driving me crazy
(Driving me crazy)
I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
I'm going out of my mind
(Going out of my mind)
I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
I'm going out of my mind
(Going out of my mind)

I'm gonna fake it to the left, and move to the right
'Cause Pokey's too slow, and Blinky's out of sight

Now I've got them on the run, and I'm looking for the high score
So it's once around the block, And I'll slide back out the side door
I'm really cookin' now, eating everything in sight
All my money's gone, so I'll be back tomorrow night

'Cause I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
It's driving me crazy
(Driving me crazy)
I've got Pac-Man fever
(Pac-Man fever)
I'm going out of my mind
(Going out of my mind)
