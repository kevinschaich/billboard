You can run, you can hide, never let it inside
Keep livin your life in the dark
Sooner or later, that gentle persuader 
Is gonna catch up with your heart

Make you a dreamer, beliver, believin in love

Right when a man's, doin all that he planned
And he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver, a shot that will shiver him
Drivin him down to his knees

Make him start giving, living, livin again

Well it's your mind, that tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well it's your heart, that talks you into stayin where you are
Love will turn you around, turn you around

Out of the blue, she reaches for you,
And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast, but you know it won't last
Cause you can't get her off of your mind

Toughts are burnin, turnin, they're turnin around

How do you know, when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign, to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel

You wanna start sharin, carin, carin again

Well it's your mind, that tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well it's your heart, that talks you into stayin where you are
Love will turn you around, turn you around

Love will turn you around, turn you around
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Turn you around
