Everybody needs a little time away
I had to say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me, I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know

Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me, I can't let go 

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to

You're gonna be the lucky one

When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us 'cause there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm gonna take you there
