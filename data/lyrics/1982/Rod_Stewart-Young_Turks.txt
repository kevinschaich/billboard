Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams
He said somehow, someway, it's gotta get better than this
Patty packed her bags, left a note for her mama, she was just 17
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night, they were so excited
We got but one shot at life, let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief, and time is a thief when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down 
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Paradise was closed, so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a two-room apartment that was jumping every night of the week 
Happiness was found in each other's arms, as expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down 
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Come on, man

Whoo

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on, on your side

Billy wrote a letter back home to Patty's parents, trying to explain
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody listening, so we just ran away
Patty gave birth to a 10-pound baby boy, yeah

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts gotta learn
Time is on, yeah, time is on your side
Time, time, time, time is on your side, is on your side, is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
