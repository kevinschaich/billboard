Gloria
You're always on the run now
Running after somebody
You gotta get him somehow

I think you've got to slow down
Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it

You really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria?

Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh
Calling Gloria

Gloria (Gloria)
I think they got your number (Gloria)
I think they got the alias (Gloria)
That you've been living under (Gloria)
But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
All the voices in your head
Calling, Gloria?

A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, Gloria
How's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound?

Will you marry for the money
Take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away
Don't believe it's comin' back soon

And you really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
All the voices in your head
Calling, Gloria?

Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh
Calling Gloria

Gloria (Gloria)
I think they got your number (Gloria)
I think they got the alias (Gloria)
That you've been living under (Gloria)
But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head
Calling, Gloria?

(Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria)...
