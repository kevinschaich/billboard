Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

On and
On and
On and

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic

Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing she do is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ma-oh
Yo-oh
Eee-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Ooh-oh
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
Getting wet
