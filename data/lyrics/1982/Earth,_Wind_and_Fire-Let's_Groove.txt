We can boogie on down, down, down, down
We can boogie on down, down, down, down

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Gonna tell you what you can do
With my love, all right
Let you know girl you're looking good
You're outta sight, all right

Just move yourself and 
You glide like a 747
And you lose yourself 
In the sky among the clouds in the heavens 'cause

Let this groove, light up your fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove, set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let me tell you what you can do
With my love, all right
Gotta let you know girl you're looking good
You're outta sight, all right

Just tell the DJ to play your favorite tune
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now

Let this groove light up the fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

You will find peace of mind on the floor
Take a little time, come and see, you with me
Give a little sign, I'll be there after a while
If you want my love
We can boogie on down, down, down, down

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove light up the fuse
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Let this groove get you to move
It's all right, all right
Let this groove set in the shoes
So stand up, all right, all right

Just move yourself
Just move yourself
