I've got nothing to be ashamed of
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
If I shy away it's only because
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

(Love's been a little)
Oh love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Ya know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

I can't remember when it meant so much
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Now I shy away from the slightest touch
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

(Love's been a little)
Oh love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

Well, come out, come out
From that hopeless romance in side
Child, it's all right, it's all right
Shade so dark, so close to the light

Well come out, well come out
From that hopeless romance in side
Child, it's all right, it's all right
Shade so dark, so close to the light

I'll be back when I calm my fears
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Then I'll see you 'round in a thousand years
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)

(Love's been a little)
Oh love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love ya know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard)
It's hard on me
