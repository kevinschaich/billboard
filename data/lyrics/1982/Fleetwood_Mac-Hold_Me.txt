Can you understand me?
Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So, baby, let me hand you my love
Oh, no step for you to dance to 
So slip your hand inside my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me

I don't want no damage
But how am I gonna manage you?
You want a percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues
I live just around the corner
If you've got a minute to spare
I'll be waiting for you
If you ever want to be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Why won't you) Hold me, hold me, hold me?
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me

(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
