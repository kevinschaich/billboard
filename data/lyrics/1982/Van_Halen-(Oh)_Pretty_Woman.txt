Wooh

Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman
I don't believe you, it must be true
No one can look as good as you
Mercy

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman
Oh, you look lovely as you can be
Are you lonely, just like me?
Arrrr

Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me

Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me

'Cause I need you
Need you tonight
Ah

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away, okay

If that's the way it must be, okay
I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see?
She's walking back to me

Whoa, whoa, pretty woman
