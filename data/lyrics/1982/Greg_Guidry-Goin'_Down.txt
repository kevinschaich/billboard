I get the feeling that I'm in way over my head
I should be careful but I'm goin deeper instead
Cause when she looks at me
I wanna run by her side
Anyone could see
A fool could drown in her eyes

And I'm goin down for the last time
I'm goin down for the last time
Goin down, out of my mind
I'm nearly out of my mind
Love is comin over, over me
It must be magic how she casts her spell over me
Her secret passions got me charmed
I'll never get free
Cause when she's holding me
She lights a fire in my soul
Any fool could see
There's only one place to go
