I swore when he hurt me so, I wouldn't see him anymore,
But today he called my name - oh, I could feel the same old flame.

Should I do it, should I fall? Should I do it after all oh?
Is it crazy, is it right? I really wanna love him tonight.
Should I do it, should I play? Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight, I'm gonna turn on like a light.

I know when we're in his car, I couldn't go just so far.
I wanna give him everything
So, when I hear the telephone ring, yeah:

Should I do it, should I fall?...
Oh, I'm so lonely and he's so fine,
Maybe I should swallow my pride
Just one, one, one more time, yeah.

Baby, I've got to know: Should I do it, should I fall?...
