Wanna see you with it
Sho' could treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight

We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip

We'll get into groovin'
Love your body language
Baby, let me know
You've got me sort of anxious

We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

So let it whip
(Let's whip it, baby)
Child
(Let's whip it right)
Get a grip
(Let's whip it baby)
(Work it all night)
Well, what's your trip
(Oh no)
Child
C'mon let it whip
Oww-hoo

Now that you can see
How you groove with me
What else can I do
To get closer to you

We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

We have the natural feeling
Obviously revealing
Let me be your paper man
I'd love to be your joker man

We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

So let it whip
(Let's whip it baby)
Child
(Let's whip it right)

You're the one I choose
I only wanna be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
