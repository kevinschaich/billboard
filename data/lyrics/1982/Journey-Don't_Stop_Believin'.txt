Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the nights
Street lights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the nights

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the nights
Street lights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the nights

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Street lights people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

Street lights people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Street lights people
