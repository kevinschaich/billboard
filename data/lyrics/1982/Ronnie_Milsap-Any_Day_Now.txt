Any day now, I will hear you say,
Good bye, my love. 
And you'll be on your way.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, I'll be all alone. 

Any day now, when your restless eyes meets someone new,
Oh, to my sad surprise,
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down. 

I know I shouldn't want to keep you, 
If you don't want to stay,
Until you're gone forever, 
I'll keep holding on for dear life.

Holding you this way, 
Begging you to stay,
Any day now,  when the clock strikes go, you'll call it off.
Then my tears will flow.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, love will let me down.
Cause you won't be around.

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town.
Any day now, love will let me down,
Cause you won't be around.
Any day now, you won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around.
