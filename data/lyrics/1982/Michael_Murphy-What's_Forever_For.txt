I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me that's gone crazy
But I can't understand out why
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever For

I see love hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And their not even tryin’ to keep it alive

So, what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for

So, what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
