Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms 
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero
And you were my leading lady

We had it all
Just like Bogey and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

Honey can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will...play it again
'Cause I love you still 
Baby this can't be the end

We had it all
Just like Bogey and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
