Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall

Mirror, mirror
On the wall

You, you turned my life 
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama

Chapter one
When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken

And now
My eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I
Remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

I talk to you each night
And I follow your advise
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go!

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

Let me go
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

Tell me mirror
Tell me mirror
Tell me mirror
Tell me mirror
