This is the time when you need a friend
You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here

How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do?
Always denied the right to live my life the way
I want, I want to share it with you

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
But what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home

There's not much time to tell you
Half the things that I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me
I keep for these moments, whoa, oh oh oh ooh

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
