When I was a young boy
Said put away those young boy ways
Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older
I long for those young boy days

With a girl like you
With a girl like you
Lord knows there are things we can do, baby
Just me and you
Come on and make it, uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

Don't have to be so excitin'
Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah
You always look so invitin'
You ain't as green as you are young

Hey baby, it's you
Come on, girl, now, it's you
Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby
Let's see what we can do
Come on and make it, uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

I ain't talkin' no big deals
I ain't made no plans myself
I ain't talkin' no high heels
Maybe we could walk around all day long
Walk around all day long
Uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

Hurt so good (come on baby, now)
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good
Eh, eh
