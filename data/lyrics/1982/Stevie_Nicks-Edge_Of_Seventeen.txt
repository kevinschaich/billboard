Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of
Seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Ooh

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standing in the hall
Yeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
A-not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a night bird
Singing "Come away" (Come away)

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
And sometime to be near you 
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
(I'm a few years older than you) My love

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
