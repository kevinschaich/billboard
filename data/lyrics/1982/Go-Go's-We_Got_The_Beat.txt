See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watching all their feet
They don't know where they want to go
But they're walking in time

They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah
They got the beat

All the kids just getting out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line

They got the beat
They got the beat
Kids got the beat
Yeah
Kids got the beat

Go-go music really makes us dance
Doin' the Pony puts us in a trance
The Watusi just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line

'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Yeah
We got it!

We got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Everybody get on your feet
(We got the beat)
We know you can dance to the beat
(We got the beat)
Jump back - get down
(We got the beat)
Round and round and round
(Woo!)

We got the beat
We got the beat (We got the beat)
We got the beat (We got the beat)
We got the beat (We got the beat)
We got the beat (We got the beat, we got the beat)
We got the beat (We got the beat, we got the beat)
We got the beat
