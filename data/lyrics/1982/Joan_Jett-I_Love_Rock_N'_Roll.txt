I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song

And I could tell it wouldn't be long 
Till he was with me, yeah me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long 
Till he was with me, yeah me

Singin'
I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

Ow!

He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
But that don't matter, he said 'cause it's all the same
He said, "Can I take you home 
Where we can be alone?"

And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were moving on
He was with me, yeah me

Singin'
I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

Ow!

He said, "Can I take you home 
Where we can be alone?"

Next we're movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
And we'll be movin' on
And singin' that same old song, yeah with me

Singin' 
I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with

I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with

I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with

I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
