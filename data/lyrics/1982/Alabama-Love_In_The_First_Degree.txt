I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be.
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time.
I never thought that I would get caught.
It seemed like a perfect crime.

Baby, you left me defenseless,
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

I thought it would be so simple,
Like a thousand times before.
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away.
But I never made it to the door.
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy.
Go ahead and throw the book at me.
If lovin' you's a crime,
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree...
