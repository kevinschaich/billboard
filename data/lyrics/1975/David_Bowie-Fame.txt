Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame

Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Really, really?

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame

Fame
What's your name?

Get me some, fame
Now get-ah, fame
