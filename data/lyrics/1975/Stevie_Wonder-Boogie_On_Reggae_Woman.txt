I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor
I like to do it to you
Till you holla for more

I like to reggae
But you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you
So you can make me scream

So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me?
Boogie on reggae woman

Fall deeply in love

Fall deeply in love, yeah

Under the stars above
