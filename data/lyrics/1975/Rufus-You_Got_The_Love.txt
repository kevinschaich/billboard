Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smilin' ? smilin'
Comes as no surprise
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
The story goes much deeper
Than the eye can ? yes it do
Stop runnin' a game
I can tell you're avoiding me

Oh ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear ? hear you say
I love you I need you

Oh ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear ? hear you say
I love you I need you

You got the love
Gimme the strength
To keep on livin'
Whatever it is
I can't do without what cha givin'

Oh ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear ? hear you say
I love you I need you

You got the love
Gimme the strength
To keep on livin' yeah
Whatever it is
I can't do without
What cha givin'
