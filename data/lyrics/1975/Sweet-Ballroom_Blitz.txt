Are you ready, Steve? Uh-ha! 
Andy? Yeah! 
Mick? Okay.
All right, fellows, let's go!

Oh, it's been getting so hard
Livin' with the things you do to me, ah-ha
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see, mm

Oh, I see a man at the back as a matter of fact
His eyes are red as the sun
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one

Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the man at the back said: "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said: "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

Oh, I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
Oh, I softly call you over
When you appear, there's nothing left of you, ah-ha

Now the man at the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

Oh yeah, it was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
'Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the man at the back said: "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said: "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
'Cause they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the man at the back said: "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said: "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
