When I think of those East End lights
Muggy nights,
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, Lord, you really should have been there,
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer,
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately,
My friend's out there,
Rolling 'round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied,
Altar-bound, hypnotized,
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly,
And butterflies are free to fly,
Fly away, high away bye bye

I never realized the passing hours
Of evening showers,
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it
Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music is still alive

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied,
Altar-bound, hypnotized,
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly,
And butterflies are free to fly,
Fly away, high away bye bye

And I would have walked head on
Into the deep end of the river,
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning
With a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength
And run the field you play alone

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied,
Altar-bound, hypnotized,
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly,
And butterflies are free to fly,
Fly away, high away bye bye

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
