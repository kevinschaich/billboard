Sitting at a fancy table, in a ritzy restaurant,
He was staring at his coffee cup,
Trying to get his courage up.
The talk was small when they talked at all,
They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

They left the bar, got in his car, and they drove away;
They drove to the Family Inn, she didn't even have to pretend.
She waited in the car and he went to the desk,
Made his request while she waited outside.
When he came back with the key she said,
"Give it to me and I'll unlock the door."

She said, "I've never done this kind of thing before, have you?"

He said, "Yes I have, but only a time or two."
