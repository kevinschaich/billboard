Hello?
Hi, honey, it's me
I went to see the doctor today
'Cause ever since you've been gone
I had had a pain deep down inside
He said there's nothing really wrong with me
I'm just missing my man
So, honey, please come on home as soon as you can

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition 
Love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion 
Full of warm emotion

Every day
A loving spoonful to be taken
It's the only way
To stop this empty heart of mine from breaking

Won't get better till 
You're back again, he told me
Doctor's orders 
I need your loving arms to hold me

Darling now I know 
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love 
I can't live without it

You're away
But please don't treat me like a stranger
Doctor's orders say
One kiss from you and I am out of danger

Please say you understand how I feel, honey
I know you've got a lot of things on your mind
Oh, but I'm missing you so bad
Please, oh, please come on home

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition 
Love's the best physician
He prescribed a potion 
Full of warm emotion

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition 
Love's the best physician
He prescribed a potion 
Full of warm emotion

Darling, now, I know 
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love
I can't live without it
