Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling
Give me all your love
Your hands build me up when I'm sinking
Touch me and my troubles all fade

Lady, from the moment I saw you
Standing all alone
You gave all the love that I needed
So shy, like a child who had grown

You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear, and lovely
You're my lady

Lady, turn me on when I'm lonely
Show me all your charms
Evenings, when you lay down beside me
Take me gently into your arms

You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear, and lovely
You're my lady

Lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear, and lovely
You're my lady
