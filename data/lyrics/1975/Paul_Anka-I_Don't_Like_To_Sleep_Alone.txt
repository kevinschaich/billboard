I don't like to sleep alone
Stay with me, don't go
Talk with me for just a while
So much of you to get to know

Reaching out, touching you
Leaving all the worries all behind
Loving you the way I do
My mouth on yours and yours on mine

Marry me, let me live with you
Nothing's wrong when love is right
Like a man said in his song
Help me make it through the night

Loneliness can get you down
When you get to thinking no one cares

Lean on me (and I'll lean on you)
Together we will see it through
No, I don't like to sleep alone
It's sad to think some folks do

No, I don't like to sleep alone
No one does, do you?
(I don't like to sleep alone)
No one does, do you?
