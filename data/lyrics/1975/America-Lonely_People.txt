This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you 
Drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single people
Thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up until you
Drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home
Hit it

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you 
Drink from the silver cup
She'll never take you down or
Never give you up
You'll never know until you try
