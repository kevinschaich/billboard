'Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet loving woman
And she know just how to treat me right

When I hold her in my arms
You know she sets my soul on fire
Oh, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her loving arms around me
It 'bout drives me out of my mind
Yeah, when my baby kisses me
Chills run up and down my spine
