Well I tried to make it Sunday
But I got so damned depressed
That I set my sights on Monday
And I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar
But I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you (Oooh)
Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes
I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle (Aah)
Will you meet me in the end
Will you love me just a little
Just enough to show you care
Well I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin'
I just can't make it

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh)
Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes
Now, I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle (Aah)
Will you meet me in the end?
Will you love me just a little
Just enough to show you care
Well I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin'
I just can't make it

Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)

Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)

Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop, doo-wop (Aah)
Mm-bop
