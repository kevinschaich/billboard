I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, I 
I never can say goodbye 

Every time I think I've had enough 
And start heading for the door 
There's a very strange vibration 
Piercing me right to the core 
It says, "turn around you fool 
You know you love him more and more"
Tell me why is it so 
Don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

I never can say goodbye, oh no, I 
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems 
Soon are all gonna work out 
But there's that same unhappy feeling 
And that anguish and that doubt 
It's that same old dizzy hang-up 
I can't do with you or without 
Tell me why is it so
I don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, ooh
Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no, no

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
No, no, no, baby, hey, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no
Please don't let me say goodbye
I just cannot say goodbye
