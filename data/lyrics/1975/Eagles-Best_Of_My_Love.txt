Every night I'm lyin' in bed
Holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every mornin', I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way and I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)

Oh sweet darlin', every night and day
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
