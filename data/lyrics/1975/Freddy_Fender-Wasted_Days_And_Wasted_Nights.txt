Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs 
To someone else

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame 
For making me blue?

Don't you remember the day
That you went away 
And left me
I was so lonely
Prayed for you only
My love

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call you're name
When you're the blame 
For making me blue

Don't you remember the day
That you went away 
And left me
I was so lonely
Prayed for you only
My love

Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame
For making me blue
