I was travellin' down the road
Feelin' hungry and cold
I saw a sign sayin'    
Food and drinks for everyone      
So naturally I thought      			
I would take me a look inside      			
I saw so much food      			
There was water coming from my eyes

Yeah, there was ham and there was turkey      			
There was caviar      			
And long tall glasses      			
With wine up to y'are      			
And somebody grabbed me      			
Threw me out of my chair      			
Said "before you can eat 
You gotta dance like fred astaire"     
You know I can't dance 
you know I can't dance     			
You know I can't dance 
you know I can't dance     		
I can't dance

I am a man of the road      		
A hobo by name      	
I don't seek entertainment      		
Just poultry and game      	
But if it's all the same to you      		
Then yes, I will try my hand      	
If you were hungry as me      	
Then I'm sure you will understand  

Hmmmmmm, now wait a minute     
Of course I can dance      
Of course I can dance     	
I'm sure I can dance      	
I'm sure I can dance      		
I can dance      
I can dance
I really hit the floor      		
Ah, it feels good      	
Look at me dancing  

I did a two-step, quick-step and a bossanova      	
A little victor sylvester and a rudy valentino      		
You should have seen me moving      	
Right across the floor      		
Hand me down my tuxedo      			
Next week I'm coming back for more

I can dance      			
Oh yes, I can dance      			
Look at me dance on the floor movin'      			
I feel good      			
I can dance     			
I can dance      			
I can dance      			
I can dance      			
I can dance      			
I can dance
