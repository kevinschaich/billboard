Got your lady on the line
Got your name on the cover
Though your friends are ninety-nine
Honey you ain't got no lover
And you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no lover
And you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no other

I remember the feelin' that I could be free-ee-ee
Now I know it could never ever be mee-ee-ee
'Cause I'm on fire
Got myself on fire, awhh!

Got your joker on the table
You've been told from time to time
I'll be willin', I'll be able
You could read between the lines

But you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no lover, lover, lover
And you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no other

I remember the feelin' that I could be free-ee-ee
Now I know it could never, never be mee-ee-ee
'Cause I'm on fire
I'm-a I'm on fire

But you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no lover, lover, lover, lover
And you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no other, other, other, other
And you ain't, you ain't
You ain't got no lover, lover, lover

I'm on fire
I'm on fire (and you ain't, you ain't
you ain't got no lover, lover, lover)
I'm on fire (lover, lover, lover, lover)
I'm on fire (lover, lover, lover)
