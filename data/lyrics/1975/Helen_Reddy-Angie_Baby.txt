You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go

Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched, you know
Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door

Angie girl, are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At the night through the window blind

I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie baby (Angie baby, Angie baby)

When he walks in her room, he feels confused
Like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
Till his soul has lost its way

And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied

It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe

Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)
Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)
(Angie baby, Angie baby)
(Angie baby, Angie baby)
