(Stop!) Oh yes, wait a minute, mister Postman
(Wait!) Wait, Mister Postman

(Please, mister Postman, look and see) 
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me) 
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?) 
Oh yeah
(For me to hear from that boy of mine)

There must be some word today
From my boyfriend, so far away
Please, mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standin' here waitin', mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning' home to me

Mister Postman 
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?)
Oh yeah
(For me to hear from that boy of mine)

So many days you passed me by
See the tears standin' in my eyes
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter

Mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yea
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?)
Why don't you check it and see one more time for me?

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)

Come on, deliver the letter, the sooner, the better

(Mister Postman)
