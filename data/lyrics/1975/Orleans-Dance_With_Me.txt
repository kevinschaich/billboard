Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

Fantasy could never be so giving
I feel free I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up and kick your feet up
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes and love is all around us
I can take you if you want to go
Oh oh

Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes and love is all around us
I can take you if you want to go
Oh oh

Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me
