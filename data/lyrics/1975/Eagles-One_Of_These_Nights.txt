One of these nights 
One of these crazy old nights 
We're gonna find out, pretty mama 
What turns on your lights

The full moon is calling 
The fever is high 
And the wicked wind whispers and moans 
You got your demons 
You got desires 
Well, I got a few of my own 

Ooh, someone to be kind to 
In between the dark and the light 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter 
Of the devil himself 
I've been searching for an angel in white 
I've been waiting for a woman
Who's a little of both 
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight 

Ooh, loneliness will blind you 
In between the wrong and the right 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights 

One of these nights
Hoo, hoo
One of these nights
I can feel it, I can feel it

One of these nights 
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you now 
One of these nights

One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you 
Coming right behind you

One of these nights
Hoo, hoo
One of these nights
