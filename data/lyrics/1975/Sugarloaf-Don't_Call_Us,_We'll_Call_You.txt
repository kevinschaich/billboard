"Uh, long distance, directory-assistance, area code 212",
I said, "Hey mama, this is Mr. Rhythm-and-Blues"
He said hello and put me on hold
To say the least, the cat was cold
He said, "Don't call us, child, we'll call you"
I said, "You got my number?"
He said, "Yeah, I got it when you walked in the door."

Don't call us...we'll call you
Don't call us...we'll call you

"I got your name from a friend of a friend
Who said he used to work with you
Do you remember the all-night preacher from Stereo-92?"
I said, "Could you relate to our quarter-track tape?
You know the band performs in the nude."
He said, "Uh-uh, don't call us, we'll call you."

"Listen kid, you pay for the call
You ain't bad, but we 've heard it all before
Yeah, it sounds like John, Paul and George."

Anyway, we cut a hit and toured a bit,
With the song he said he couldn't use
And now he calls, and begs and crawls,
It's telephone Deja Vu
We got percentage points and lousy joints
And all the glitter we can use, mama,
So, huh, don't call us, we'll call you!

You may have heard this one before, too:
"Listen kid, you pay for the call
Well, you ain't bad but I've heard it all before."

Don't call us...we'll call you.
Don't call us...we'll call you.
