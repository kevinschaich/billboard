Hearts afire creates love desire
Take you high and higher
To the world you belong

Hearts afire creates love desire
High and higher
To your place on the throne

We've come together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear, hmmm
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days
Future, past, they disappear

You will find (you will find)
Peace of mind (yeah)
If you look way down
In your heart and soul
Ah, don't hesitate
'Cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart
Ah, 'cause you're never
Never old at heart

Never, never, yeah, yeah

That's the way (that's the way)
Of the world (of the world)
Plant your flower (plant your flower)
And you grow a pearl

Child is born
With a heart of gold
Way of the world (oh plant your flower)
Makes his heart so cold

Oh, ho no, yeah, yeah

Hearts afire creates love desire
Take you high and higher
To the world you belong

Hearts afire, love desire
High and higher
You, you, you
Hearts afire, love desire
High and higher
