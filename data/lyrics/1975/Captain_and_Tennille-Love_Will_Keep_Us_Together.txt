Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talkin' girl comes along, singin' a song
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong

Just stop, 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You (you, do do do) you belong to me now (do, do do do)
Ain't gonna set ya free now (do do do)
When those girls start hangin' around, talkin' me down
Hear with your heart and ya won't hear a sound

Just stop (stop, stop) 'cause I really love you (really love you)
Stop (stop, stop) I been thinkin' of you (been thinkin' of you)
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever

Young and beautiful
But someday your looks'll be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will

I will be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before and I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need ya now and I need ya then

Just stop (stop) 'cause I really love you (really love you)
Stop (stop) I been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Whatever (a-ba-da whatever)
I will (ever), I will (ever), I will (ever), I will, ah

You better stop (stop) cause I really love you (really love you)
Stop (stop) I been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Whatever (a-ba-da whatever)
I will (ever), I will (ever), I will (ever), I will (ahh)
