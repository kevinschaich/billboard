In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox 
With the best of country music, old and new 
You can hear your five selections for a quarter 
And somebody else's songs when yours are through 

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter 
And my friends around to help me ease the pain 
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song 
And here I am just missing you again 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again 

If I had a dime for every time I held you 
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me 
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville 
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee 

But I guess I'd better get myself together 
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind 
Just a note that said "I'm sorry" by your picture 
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again
