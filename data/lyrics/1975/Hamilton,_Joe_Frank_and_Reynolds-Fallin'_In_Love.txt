Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again

I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came and
Made my dreams match reality

Maybe you can see
All the things you`ve meant to me
But simple fate is the gate
And, girl, you`ve got the key

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again

And it seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love can grow
With each and every day

As we lay at midnight`s hour
And feel love`s hidden power
So strong and bold as life unfolds
It`s mystery to me

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again

You and me for eternity
In love we`ll always be
So young, and free and that
Should be the way it`s got to be

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I`m fallin' in love again
