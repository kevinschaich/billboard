How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) so I could thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

How sweet it is...

And it feels just about right

Ohhh.....

Just to be loved
Just to be loved by you, baby, yeah
