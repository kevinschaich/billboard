Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise and early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
Raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
But the kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy

I'd play "Sally Goodin" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, wooh

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folks drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people think that's mighty keen
Son, let me tell you exactly what I mean
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
He said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy"

Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Wooh, thank God I'm a country boy, yes
