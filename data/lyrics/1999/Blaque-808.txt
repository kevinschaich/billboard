See what I beleive is
We was granted the power
Whats that the power to what
The power to make u dance
(like this)

I heard shes got a 9 to 5
But coming in after 12
I know your tired of her lies
Just let her go whats the deal
Now take me for instance babe
See my love will drive you crazy

Cause I'll be going boom like an 808
Be makin circles like a figure 8
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go
You'll be going boom baby boom baby boom
And I'll be going oh baby oh baby oh

I heard shes not all that to you
Cause she cant do it like I do
So put that trophy on the shelf
Go out and find somebody else
Now take me for instance baby
My love will drive you crazy

Cause I'll be going boom like an 808
Be makin circles like a figure 8
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go
You'll be going boom baby boom baby boom
And I'll be going oh baby oh baby oh

Ain't nobody can bang it like me
Stack it like me, wouldn't like me
Ask Kelly, his original plan
To get as large on the map, by makin' you clap your hands
Damn sho bizzatch, I'm not gonna lie
I'll pump my amps to this
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy take me to lunch
Oh, ya'll done did it now, with the luscious music
World poppin' crews, and what, 8-0 grooves
Is what intended, you to get me up you
You one in a mill, forget the mens
Cause they ride in my pockets baby
And today I just wanna
Jiggle my ball
Bet I knock your socks off
Wit' my what what what (wha wha wha wha wha)
Yea yea
