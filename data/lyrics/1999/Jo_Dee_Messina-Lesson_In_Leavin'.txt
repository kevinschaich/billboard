Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin' 
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin' 
And I hope that I'm around 
To watch 'em knock you down 
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em 
Just like you loved me and left me 
It's like you to do that sort of thing 
Over and over again 
You're a fool-hearted man 

I hear you've been askin' about me 
From some of my friends 
Well you'd better believe I'm not goin' 
Through that again 
You're the kind of man a woman thinks she can change 
Oh, but the only thing changin' is my way of thinkin' 
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday 

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in losin' 
Somebody's gonna do to you what you've been doin' 
And I hope that I'm around 
To watch 'em knock you down 
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in hurtin' 
Somebody's gonna leave you with your fire burnin' 
And no way to put it out 
Baby there ain't no doubt 
You're a fool-hearted man 

Yeah, you're the kind of man 
A woman thinks she can change 
But the only thing changin' 
Is my way of thinkin' 
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday 

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin' 
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin' 
And I hope that I'm around 
To watch 'em knock you down (oh)
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em 
Just like you loved me and left me 
It's like you to do that sort of thing 
Over and over again 
You're a fool-hearted man 

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin' 
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin' 
And I hope that I'm around 
To watch 'em knock you down 
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em 
Just like you loved me and left me 
It's like you to do that sort of thing 
Over and over again 
You're a fool-hearted man 

Oh, a fool-hearted man 
Oh, whoa 
Oh, a fool-hearted man
