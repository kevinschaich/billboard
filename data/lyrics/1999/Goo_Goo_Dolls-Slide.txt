Could you whisper in my ear
The things you want to feel?
I'll give you anything
To feel it comin'
Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are?
You live with all your faults

I want to wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?

Yeah, we're gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you'd kill?
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
Don't suppose I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
If there's something I can't change
I'll live around it

I want to wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?
Mm, slide

And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May, put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May, do you wanna get married
Or run away?

Ooh
Ooh-hoo

And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May, put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May, do you wanna get married
Or run away?

I want to wake up where you are
I won't say anything

(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall

(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall

(Yeah, slide)
Oh, May
Why don't you slide into my room?
Just slide into my room
And we'll run away, run away, run away
