If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we
Could possibly
Spend eternity
See that's what you told me
That's what you said

But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, babe

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt
And I don't need the pain

So before I do
Give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
What would you do babe, tell me right now

And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
Don't you lie to me

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me (comfort me)
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
Don't you dare lie to me, baby

Mmm, yeah
Ooh na, na, na
Ooh

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
What would you do if I gave it to you?

And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
