Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheel
The wheel of possibility, however it may roll
Give it a spin, see if it can somehow factor in
You know there's always more than one way
To say exactly what you mean to say

Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet that I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too

Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an invitation
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up... too
