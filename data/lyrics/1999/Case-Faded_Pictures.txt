That's right
Life is funny ain't it
Sometimes you can end up with
Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out
Check it

She was more than a women, a goddess for all to see
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the groovin' of love was on
But I still remember how it felt when her love was gone

(Bridge)
Tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time

(Chorus)
Faded pictures in a broken glass
Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
'Cos it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass

As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way
As she stopped and she came to a page where her diary end
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
'Cos she's lost inside the past (x2)

(Chorus)

Faded pictures in a broken glass
