Someday
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why you were always there for me

One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Some say
Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say
You were always there for me 

Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from
Another time
And fade away
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm, without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Someone said you tried to long
Someone said we got it all
Someone said we tried to long
Is there a place where I belong

So far, so long
So far away
So far, so wrong
So far away
Away, away

Someday when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me

One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I'll look around for another try and fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
