Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change

I think that you could be
Whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize
All the dreams you have inside
Don't be afraid
If you've got something to say
Just open up your heart
And let it show you the way

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change

Believe in yourself
Reach down inside (ohh-oooh)
The love you find will set you free
Believe in yourself (ohh-oooh)
You will come alive
Have faith in what you do
You'll make it through

Ohh-wooahh-ohh
Heeeeeyyy

Don't you ever wish (ohhhhh yeah)
You were someone else
You were meant to be (you were meant to be)
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say (Ohh-wooahh-ohh)
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself (love yourself)
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same (stay the same)
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change (change)

No, there's nothing 'bout you I would change ...

Don't change ...
