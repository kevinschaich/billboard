You'll never know what you've done for me
Put your faith in me has done for my soul
And you'll never know the gift you've given me
I'll carry it with me
Through the days ahead I'll think of days before
You made me hope for something better,
And made me reach for something more

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

You were the one
Always on my side (always on my side)
Always standing by (always standing by)
Seeing me through
You were the song that always made me sing (made me sing, made me sing)
I'm singin this for you (singin this for you baby)
Everywhere I go I'll think of where I've been
And of the one who knew me better than anyone ever will again

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

What you taught me
Only your love could ever teach me
You got through when no one could reach me before
'cuz you always saw in me
All the best that I could be
It was you who set me free

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

...Is the music of my heart...
