Yeah
(We're gonna do it like this)
Aight, let's go
Jigga

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
You almost kinda watching this
Aha
Whooo!
Escape

Ooh your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst
Of you and I can not resist at all

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leave me feelin' blue?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know are stated
To relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feelin' blue
Would you go and break my heart? 

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

OK
Cool
Aight
Yo
She wanna shop wit Jay, play box wit Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand a hair longer than hers

She want make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib
Keys to da newbie
She wanna answer the phone
Tattoo her arm
Last one I got her
Sent it back to her mom

She call me heartbreaker
When we apart it makes her
Wanna piece of paper,
Scribble down 'I hate ya'
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does, and a

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
