Alabama & N Sync
Lyrics by:  Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken

Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole.
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this.
Then you changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be, that right here with me,
there's an angel, it's a miracle.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true,
God must have spent a little more time on you.

In all of creation,  all things great and small,
You are the one that surpasses them all.
More precious than any diamond or pearl,
They broke the mold when you came in this world.

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without.
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child,
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, 
God must have spent a little more time on you.

I never thought that love could feel like this,
then you changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be, that right here with me,
There's an angel, it's a miracle.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true,
God must have spent a little more time on you.
God must have spent a little more time on you.
