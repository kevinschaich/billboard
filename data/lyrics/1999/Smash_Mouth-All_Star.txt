Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead

Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the media men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars

Somebody once asked "Could I spare some change for gas?"
"I need to get myself away from this place"
I said "Yep, what a concept"
"I could use a little fuel myself"
"And we could all use a little change"

Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
