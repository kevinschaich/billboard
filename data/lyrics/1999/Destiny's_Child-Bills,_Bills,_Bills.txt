At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did before
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Driving all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity to even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me until you get your check next week

You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
A baller, when times get hard need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby, if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card (card)
Givin' me bad credit, buyin' gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady heading to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetrating to your friends that you be ballin'

And then you use my cell phone (phone)
Calling whoever that you think at home
And then when the bill comes all of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mama's number's here more than once

You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
A baller, when times get hard need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby, if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another

You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
You trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
Baby if you do we could chill

I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Thou shall confess
