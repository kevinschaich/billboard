Many nights we prayed, with no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts, a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could

Oh yes, there can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe, mmm, yeah

Ohh, in this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds, too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here, my heart so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will, you will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
Ohh, but when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still resilient voice says hope is very near 

There can be miracles
Miracles
When you believe
Boy, when you believe, ohh
Though hope is frail, it's hard...
Hard to kill, yeah

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? 
You can achieve, ohh
When you believe, somehow you will
Somehow, somehow, somehow

Somehow you will
I know, I know, know
You will when you believe
When you believe...

Ohh, you will when you...
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will, you will
Just believe
You will when you believe
