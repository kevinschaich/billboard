Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe, when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are
Don't wanna hear you say

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(I wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say
Oh yeah
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
(I wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
'Cause I want it that way
