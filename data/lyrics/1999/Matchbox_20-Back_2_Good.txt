It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there, I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to
I was thinking, if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

And everyone here knows everyone here is thinking about somebody else
Well it's best if we all keep it under our heads
I couldn't tell if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how to get it back to good

This don't mean that you own me
Well, this ain't no good, in fact it's funny as hell
But things worked out just like you wanted to
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
To figure out just what I'm going to do

'Cause everyone here hates everyone here for doing just like they do
And it's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now
And I don't know how to get it back to good

And everyone here is wondering what it's like to be with somebody else
And everyone here's to blame
And everyone here gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain
Yeah, well everyone here hides shades of shame
But looking inside we're the same, we're the same
And we're all grown now
Yeah, but we don't know how to get it back to good

But everyone here knows everyone here is thinking 'bout somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads (yeah, our heads)
Yeah, see, I couldn't tell now, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But it's over now
Yeah I don't know how
Guess it's over now
There's no getting back to good
