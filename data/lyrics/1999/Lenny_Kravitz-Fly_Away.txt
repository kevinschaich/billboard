I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high
Just like a dragonfly

I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas
In all degrees
To anywhere I please

Oh, I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way
Or even Mars
Where it could just be ours

Let's fade into the sun
Let your spirit fly
Where we are one
Just for a little fun, oh oh oh yeah

I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got to get away, get away
Girl, I gotta get away, get away
Oh, oh, oh yeah

I want to get away
I'll fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah (with you) oh yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah (with you)
I got to get away

I want to get away
I want to get away
I want to get away
I want to get away, yeah

I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah (with you)
I gotta get away

I want to get away
I want to get away
I want to get away
I want to get away, yeah

I want to get away
I wanna fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah (with you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
