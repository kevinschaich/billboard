(Eric)
I never knew such a day could come
And I never knew such a love
Could be inside of one
And I never knew what my life was for
But now that you're here I know for sure

(Tamia)
I never knew till I looked in your eyes
I was incomplete till the day you walked into my life
And I never knew that my heart could feel
So precious and pure
One love so real

(Eric and Tamia)
Can I just see you every morning when
I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me
Every night
Can we just feel this way together
Till the end of all time
Can I just spend my life with you

(Eric)
Now baby the days and the weeks
And the years will roll by
But nothing will change the love inside
Of you and I

(Tamia)
And baby I'll never find any words
That could explain
Just how much my heart my life
My soul you've changed

Can you run to these open arms
When no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world
I'm your woman, and you're my man
Can't you just feel how much I love you
With one touch of my hand
Can I just spend my life with you

(Eric)
No touch has ever felt so wonderful
(You are incredible)

(Tamia)
And a deeper love I've never known
(I'll never let you go)
I swear this love is true
(Now and forever to you to you)

(Eric and Tamia)
Can I just see you every morning when
I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me
Every night
Can we just feel this way together
Till the end of all time
Can I just spend my life with you
Can you run to these open arms

When no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world
You're my woman, and you're my man
Can't you just feel how much I love you
With one touch of my hand
Can I just spend my life with you

Can I just spend my life with you
Can I just spend my life with you
(Forever here with you)

(Eric)
Can I just spend my life with you

(Tamia)
Can I just see you every morning when I
Open my eyes
