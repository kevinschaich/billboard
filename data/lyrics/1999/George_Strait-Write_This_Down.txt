I never saw the end in sight, fools are kinda blind
Thought everything was going all right, but I was running out of time
'Cause you have one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a book mark, stick it on your frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantle where you can see it for sure

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

You can find the chisel, I can find the stone
Folks'll be a-readin these words, long after we're gone

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

Oh, I love you and I dont want you to go
Baby write this down
