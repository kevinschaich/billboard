(Verse 1):
See he's my property
And any girl that touch him
I might just call you bluff
Coz I don't give a
Who? Oh, oh, are you to call my cell?
Oh, I'ma wish you well
'Cause any girl that's tried has failed

(Chorus):
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin'that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryin' to take my man see I don't need that
So don't play yourself

(Chorus):
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin'that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryin' to take my man see I don't need that
So don't play yourself

Hey, hey, hey, hey

(Verse 2):
Don't you violate me
Cause I'ma make you hate me
If you decide to mess with mine
Shrunk you down to size
Make you realize
You done messed up this time

(Chorus):
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin'that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryin' to take my man see I don't need that
So don't play yourself

(Bridge):
You must learn the rules
Don't come close to
Anythin' that belongs to me
He is mine, my property
So you must leave
Yeah

(Chorus):
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well, is you feelin'that?
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that?
Tryin' to take my man see I don't need that
So don't play yourself
