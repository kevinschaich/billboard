I wanna be around, to pick up the pieces -
When somebody breaks your heart -
Some, Somebody twice as smart as I -
A somebody who would swear to be true,
As you used to do with me -
Who'll leave you to learn,
That misery loves company -
Wait and see.

I mean I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits -
Let's see if that puzzle really fits, so fine -
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet,
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat -
When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine.

When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine -
Oh yeah.

Then...

That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet.
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat -
Somebody breaks your heart, Yes, Like you broke
Mine -
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke
Mine -
Oh yeah.
