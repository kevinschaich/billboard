(Blue velvet)

She wore blue velvet 
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light 
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs 
Love was ours

Ours, a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

She wore blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be 
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

(Blue velvet, ooh)
