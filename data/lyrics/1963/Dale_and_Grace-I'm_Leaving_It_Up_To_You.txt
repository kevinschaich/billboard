I'm leavin' it all up to you oh oh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love?
Or are we through?

That's why I'm leaving it up to you oh oh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love?
Or are we through?

My heart in my hand
I, I don't understand
Baby, what, what have I done wrong?
I worship, I worship the ground that you walk on
That's why I'm leavin' it up to you oh oh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love?
Or are we through?
