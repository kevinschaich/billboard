Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring

No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know
I love you so (love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile

Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)

Our dreams have magic because
W'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come
Our day will come
