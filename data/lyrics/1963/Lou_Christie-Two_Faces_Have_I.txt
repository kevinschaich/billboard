I don't want the world to know
I don't want my heart to show

Two faces have I
I pretend that I'm happy
But I'm Mr. blue
I pretend that I'm happy
Since I lost you

Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry

Will I ever laugh again
She'll never see me cry
Will I walk with a smile on my face
Kniowing I live a lie

I pretend that I'm carefree
But what am I
I pretend that I'm carefree
But I'm living a lie

Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
