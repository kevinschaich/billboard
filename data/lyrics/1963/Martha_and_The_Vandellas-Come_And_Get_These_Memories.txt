Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read them any more

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear
(Come and get it)
That you won for me
At the state fair

Here's some old valentine cards
(Come and get em)
Give them to your new sweetheart

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come and get em
Come and get em
Come and get em

Here's our old favorite record
(Come and get it)
I can't stand to hear it anymore

Here's some old lingering love
(Come and get it)
It's in my heart and
It's tearing it apart

Because of these memories
I never think of anybody but you
So, come on and get em
Cause I found me somebody new

Come and get these memories
(Come and get em)
Since you've gone out of my life

So my mind and my
Heart can leave that easy
(Come and get em)
Since you've gone out of my life

Give them to your new love
Give them to your new love

So come on and get these memories
(Come and get em)
Since you've gone out of my life
