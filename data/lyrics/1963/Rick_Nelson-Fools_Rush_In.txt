Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love
My heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Well open up your heart and let this fool rush in
