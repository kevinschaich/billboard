You're sweet (you're sweet) as a honeybee 
But like a honeybee stings 
You've gone and left my heart in pain 
All you left (all you left) is our favorite song 
The one we danced to all night long 
It used to bring sweet memories (Sweet memories)
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
It's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you been gone)
And it breaks me up to hear it

Ah, oh, ah, sentimental fool am I (Sweet memories)
To hear a old love song and want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Staying (Together forever)
Darling (Breaking up never)

(Now it's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it 
(With a different meaning since you been gone)
Oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone

Precious memories keep a-lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness 
I only reminisce the happiness we spent 
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

Now it's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone
Now it's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone
I, oh, I can't bear to hear it 
It's the same old song
(But with a different meaning since you been gone)
Ooh, it breaks me up to hear it) 
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning
