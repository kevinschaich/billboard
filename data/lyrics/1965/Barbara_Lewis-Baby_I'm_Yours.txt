Baby I'm yours
 And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
 Yours until the rivers all run dry
 In other words, until I die

 Baby I'm yours
 And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
 Yours until the poets run out of rhyme
 In other words, until the end of time

 I'm gonna stay right here by your side
 Do my best to keep you satisfied
 Nothing in the world can drive me away
 'Cause every day you'll hear me say

 Baby I'm yours
 And I'll be yours until two and two is three
 Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
 In other words, until eternity

 Baby I'm yours
 'Till the stars fall from the sky
 Baby I'm yours
 'Till the rivers all run dry
 Baby I'm yours
 'Till the poets run out of rhyme
 Baby I'm yours
