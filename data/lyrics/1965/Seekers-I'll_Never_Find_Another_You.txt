There's a new world somewhere
They call the promised land.
And I'll be there someday
If you could hold my hand.
I still need you there beside me
No matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you.

There is always someone
For each of us, they say.
And you'll be my someone 
Forever and a day.
I could search the whole world over
Until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you.

It's a long, long journey 
So stay by my side.
When I walk through the storm 
You'll be my guide, be my guide.
If they gave me a fortune
My virtue would be small.
I could lose it all tomorrow
And never mind at all.
But if I should lose your love, dear,
I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you.

But if I should lose your love, dear,
I don't know what I'd do.
For I know I'll never find another you.
Another you.
Another you!
