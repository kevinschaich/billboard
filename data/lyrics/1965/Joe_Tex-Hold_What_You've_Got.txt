That a man can have a good woman
That he can call his very own
A woman who will stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work 
A woman who will have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is 
When they go out and stay because they feel 
No other wants his woman but him
Well listen, if you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some men will have her before you can count 1, 2, 3
Yes he will, yes he will

Listen girls, this goes for you too 
Because you know I've seen so man women
Who've had so many good men in life
Men who would stand by them thru thick and thin
Men who'd go to work everyday and 
Bring home their hard earned pay 
Men who'd give their woman anything 
Their little hearts desired
Where some women make mistakes is 
When their men go out and let em play they would stay 
Because they felt that no other woman wanted him but her
Well listen, if you think no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the street and you will see
Some woman will have your man 
Before you can count 1, 2, 3
Yes she will, yes she will
