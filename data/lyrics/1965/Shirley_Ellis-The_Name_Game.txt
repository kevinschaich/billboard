Come on everybody! 
I say now let's play a game 
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name 
The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there 
But a B or an F or an M will appear 
And then I say bo add a B then I say the name and Bonana fanna and a 
fo 
And then I say the name again with an F very plain 
and a fee fy and a mo 
And then I say the name again with an M this time 
and there isn't any name that I can't rhyme 

Arnold! 
Arnold, Arnold bo Barnold Bonana fanna fo Farnold 
Fee fy mo Marnold Arnold! 

But if the first two letters are ever the same, 
I drop them both and say the name like 
Bob, Bob drop the B's Bo ob 
For Fred, Fred drop the F's Fo red 
For Mary, Mary drop the M's Mo ary 
That's the only rule that is contrary. 

Okay? Now say Bo: Bo 
Now Tony with a B: Bony 
Then Bonana fanna fo: bonana fanna fo 
Then you say the name again with an F very plain: Fony 
Then a fee fy and a mo: fee fy mo 
Then you say the name again with an M this time: Mony 
And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme 

Every body do Tony! 
Pretty good, let's do Billy! 
Very good, let's do Marsha! 
A little trick with Nick!
