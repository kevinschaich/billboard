(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)
I'd give you everything and more, and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight
I'll give you diamonds bright
There'll be things that will excite
To make you dream of me at night

(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)

For your love, for your love
I would give the stars above
For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)
I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd give the stars and the sun 'fore I live
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight
I'll give you diamonds bright
There'll be things that will excite
To make you dream of me at night

(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)
