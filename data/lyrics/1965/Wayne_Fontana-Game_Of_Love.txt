The purpose of a man is to love a woman
And the purpose of a woman is to love a man
So come on baby, let's start today, come on baby, let's play
The game of love, love, la la la la la love
(Love, love)

It started long ago in the Garden of Eden
When Adam said to Eve, baby, you're for me
So come on baby, let's start today, come on baby, let's play
The game of love, love, la la la la la love
(Love, love)

Come on baby 'cause the time is right
Love your daddy with all your might
Put your arms around me, hold me tight
Play the game of love

The purpose of a man is to love a woman
And the purpose of a woman is to love a man
So come on baby, let's start today, come on baby, let's play
The game of love, love, la la la la la love
(Love, love)

Yeah
Oh yeah

Well, come on baby 'cause the time is right
Love your daddy with all your might
Put your arms around me, hold me tight
Play the game of love

The purpose of a man is to love a woman
And the purpose of a woman is to love a man
So come on baby, let's start today, come on baby, let's play
The game of love, love, la la la la la love
(Love, love)

The game of love baby, the game of la la la la love
The game of love baby, the game of la la la la love
The game of love baby
