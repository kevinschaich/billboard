Well, I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no, oh no

Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
There's too much pain and too much sorrow
I guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no, oh no

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no, oh no

Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
'Cause I'll be gone a long, long time

Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no, oh no
Well, this could be the last time
