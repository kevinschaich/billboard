Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go 

I never had a mother, I hardly knew my dad 
I've been in town for 18 years 
You're the only boy I've had 
I can't stay, maybe I'll be back some day 

Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go 
I love you so, pretty baby please don't go 

I never had no money, I bought at the second hand store 
The way this old town laughs at me 
I just can't take it no more 
I can't stay, I'm gonna be a lady some day 

Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go 
I love you so, pretty baby please don't go 

When I get to the city, my tears will all be dry 
My eyes will look so pretty 
No one's gonna know I cried 
Yes I'm goin' away, maybe I'll be back some day 

Baby don't go, maybe I'll be back some day
