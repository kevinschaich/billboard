I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She oughtta think twice
She oughtta do right by me

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care
