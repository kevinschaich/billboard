I'm telling you now
I'm telling you right away
I'll be staying for many a day
I'm in love with you now

I'm telling you now
I'll say what you wanna hear
I'll be telling you for many a year
I'm in love with you now

Do you think I'm foolin'
When I say "I love you"?
I love you
Maybe you'll believe me
When I'm finally through, through, through, through

I'm telling you now
I know it's been said before
Say you love me and I will be sure
I'm in love with you now

I'm telling you now
I'm telling you right away
I'll be staying for many a day
I'm in love with you now

Do you think I'm foolin'
When I say "I love you"?
I love you
Maybe you'll believe me
When I'm finally through, through, through, through

I'm telling you now
I know it's been said before
Say you love me and I will be sure
I'm in love with you now
I'm in love with you now
I'm telling you now
