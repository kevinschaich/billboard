Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say: "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it

You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: "Do you want to
Make a deal?"

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
