Every time I see you lookin' my way
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
In the car or walkin' down the highway
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you move up closer to me
I get a feeling that's ooo-wee

Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

When I feel you put your arms around me
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you asked me to meet your ma
I knew that baby, we'd be going far

Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

All my friends are cryin' out to meet you
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Wedding bells are gonna chime
Baby, baby, you're gonna be mine

Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
