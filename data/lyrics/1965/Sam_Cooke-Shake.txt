Shake!
Shake!
Shake!
Shake!

Listen

Listen while I talk to you
I tell you what we're gonna do
There's a new thing that's going around
And I'll tell you what they're puttin' down

Just move your body all around
And just shake
Oh, mamma
Shake
Thats the way to do it
Shake
Oh, you're looking good now
Shake
Yeah, ha

Shake it like a bowl of soup
And make your body loop de loop
Put your hands on your hips
And kinda let your backbone slip
Move your body like a whip
And just shake!

Umm, that's doing it
Shake
Yeah, you're looking good now
Shake
Go on, do it baby
Shake
Yeah, Ohh

A ring-a-ling-a-ling
Honey, shakin' is the latest thing
And if you wanna swing
Just loosen up them shoulders

And if you wanna really roll
You got to do the thing with soul
Shake the shake with all your might
Oh, if you do it, do it right
Just make your body loose and light
And kinda shake
Oh, honey

Shake
Hoooo
Shake
Oh, that's the way to do it
Shake
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-yeah

Alright

Oh, you're doing it now honey

C'mon, loosen up them shoulders

If you wanna really roll
Got to do the thing with soul
Shake the shake with all your might
Now, if you do it, do it right
Make your body loose and light
And just shake

Oh, I like to do it
Shake
Make me feel good now
Shake
All gone baby
Shake
Don't be shy now
Shake
Dance, with you mama
Shake
Don't, do it baby
Shake
Oh, yeah
Shake
