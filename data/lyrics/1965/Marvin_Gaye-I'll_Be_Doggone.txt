Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day (baby)
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay (baby)
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone, hmmm

Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone, hmmm

Now did you hear 
Well now, what I say ?
Oh, believe me 

Well, every woman should try
To be whatever has man wants her to be
And I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me

Well, I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend (baby)
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't be doggone baby
I'd be long gone
