I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night

I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and night I'm yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
Oh, come on

I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and night I'm yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night time
All day and all of the night
