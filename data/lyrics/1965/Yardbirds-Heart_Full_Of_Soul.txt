Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
Where is she tell me where
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know if she had me back again
Well I would never make her sad
I've gotta heart full of soul

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea
