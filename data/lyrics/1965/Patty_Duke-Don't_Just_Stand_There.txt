Please don't just stand there
Come and kiss me like before
Please don't just stand there
Looking down at the floor

If something is wrong
Give me just one little sign
If there's someone else, please tell me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

Once when we'd meet
You'd run to hold me tight
Life was so sweet until tonight

Please don't just stand there
Get it over if we're through
Please don't just stand there
While my heart breaks in two
Knowing I care, how can you be so unkind?
Please stop hurting me and help me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

If it's a game
I don't want to play it
And if it's goodbye
Why can't you just say it?

Why make me cry like you do?
How can you be so unkind
Please start loving me or leave me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

Don't just stand there
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

Don't just stand there
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

Don't just stand there
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind
