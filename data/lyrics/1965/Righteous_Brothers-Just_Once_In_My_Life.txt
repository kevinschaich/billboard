There's a lot of things I want
A lot of things that I'd like to be
But girl I don't forsee a rags to riches story for me
It's just one little thing I got to make come true
It's just one round I've got to win
I can't be a loser with you

Baby baby just once in my life
I'm gonna get what I want girl don't let me down
Just once in my life let me hold on to
The good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying

Cause I couldn't face the day if you weren't here by my side
And if you went away then I'd be left without any pride
I've given up on schemes cause everyone fell through
I've given up so many things don't ask me to give up on you

And baby, baby just once in my life
I'm gonna get what I want girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying

That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find
But if you'll stand by me
Girl I'll keep peace of mind
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
I'll work hard, everyday, all my life,
If you'll say you won't leave me,
Baby don't leave me,
Please don't leave me
Baby don't leave me,
Just do this for me baby,

Once in my life, let me get what I want,
Girl don't let me down;
Just once in my life, let me hold onto a good thing I've found, don't
Let me down,
Baby say that you'll be stayin' Mmmm,
Oh yeah, Mmmm

Just once in my life let me get what I want,
Girl don't let me down;
Just once in my life let me hold onto
A good thing I've found, don't let me down. (fade)
