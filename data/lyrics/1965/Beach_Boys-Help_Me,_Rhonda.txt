Well, since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head
I come in late at night
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed

Well, Rhonda, you look so fine (Look so fine)
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda

And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it ruined our plans

And I give you lotsa reasons why
