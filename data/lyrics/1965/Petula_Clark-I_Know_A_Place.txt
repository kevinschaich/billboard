Every day when the work is behind you
and the shop and the store put the lock on the door,
just get away where your worries won't find you.
If you like, well, I'll tell you more.

Don't let the day get the better of you.
When the evening comes, there's so much to do!
You'd better put on your best and wear a smile.
Come along with me a while
'cause I tell you

CHORUS:
I know a place
where the music is fine and the lights are always low!
I know a place 
where we can go.

At the door there's a man who will greet you.
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs.
Soon, I'm sure, you'll be tapping your feet
because the beat is the greatest there.

All around there are girls and boys.
It's a swingin' place,
a cellar full of noise!
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow.
You gotta come along right now!
'Cause I tell you

CHORUS

- musical interlude - 

Well, all around there are girls and boys.
It's a swingin' place,
a cellar full of noise.
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow.
You've gotta come along right now!
'Cause I tell you

CHORUS

I know a place where we can go!
I know a place where the lights are low!
I know a place where we can go! 
I know a place where the lights are low!
(repeat and fade out)
