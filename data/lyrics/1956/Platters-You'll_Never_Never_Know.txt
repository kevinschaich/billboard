(You'll never know)
You'll never, never know I care
You'll never know the torch I bear
You'll never know it, for I won't show it
Oh, no, you'll never, never know

(You'll never know)
You'll never, never see me cry
Not even when you're glancing by
For I won't weaken, when we're speaking
Oh, no, you'll never, never know

You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore

(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truely feel
But if you guess it
I'll confess it
Oh, darling now the time to plot
Or else you'll never, never know

You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore

(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truely feel
But if you guess it
I'll confess it
Oh, darling now the time to plot
Or else you'll never
No, no you'll never
Oh, no you'll never, ever know
(You'll never know)
