I'm in love with a dolly named 'Glendora' 
She works in the window of a big department stor-a! 
Eyes of blue, hair like gold, 
Never been young, but she'll never get old . . . 
Oh Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you! 

O' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . . 
O' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you! 

She's so shy that I don't know how I found her, 
With three big body guards always workin' around her! 
One just nods, an' two just grins, 
An' three got a mouth full of safety pins . . . 
O' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you! 
( You . . . more of you! ) 

O' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . . 
O' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you! 
(  . . . more of you! ) 

I stand left an' I stand right, 
Outta my head 'cause I'm outta sight . . . 
O' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you! 

Late last night at the store they did some changin' . . . 
An' I stood watchin' when they started re-arrangin' . . . 
She lost her wig, she lost her arms, 
An' when they got through she lost all of her charms, 
O' Glendora . . . what did they do to you? 

What they do, what they do, what they do ? 
O' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . . 
O' Glendora . . . what did they do to you? 

What they do, what they do, what they do ? 
O' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . . 
O' Glendora . . . what did they do to you? 

Do to you, oh what did they do to you? 
O' Glendora . . . what did they do to you?
