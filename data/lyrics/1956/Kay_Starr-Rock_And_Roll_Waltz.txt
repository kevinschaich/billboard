One night I was late, came home from a date 
Slipped out of my shoes at the door 
Then from the front room, I heard a jump tune 
I looked in and here's what I saw 

There in the night what a wonderful scene 
Mom was dancing with Dad to my record machine 
And while they danced, only one thing was wrong 
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song

One, two and then rock 
One, two and then roll 
They did the rock and roll waltz 
Rock, two, three, roll, two, three 
It looked so cute to me 
I love the rock and roll waltz 

One, two and then rock 
One, two and then roll 
One, two and then jump 
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
