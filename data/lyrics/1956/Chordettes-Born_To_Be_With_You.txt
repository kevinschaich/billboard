By your side, satisfied
Through and through
Cause I was born to be with you

Humming first verse

Wondrously, love can see
So I knew that I was born to be with you

Humming and whistling last verse

Do I find
Peace of mind
Yes I do
Cause I was born to be with you
All life through
Yes,  I was born to be with you
