Why this feeling? Why this glow?
Why the thrill when you say hello?
It's a strange and tender magic you do
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away
And I'm left with one point of view
Mister Wonderful, that's you

One more thing, then I'm through
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful, I love you
