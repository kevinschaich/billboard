On Saturday night
Where I was born
Down on the farm
Guitar plinkin'
And we started singin'
Till the break of dawn

About twelve o'clock
Everything gets hot
Up steps Bob Jones
We started clappin'
And he started singin'
Sweet little country songs

Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Where ya been all day?
Your Mama's been lookin'
Hasn't stopped lookin'
Since you went away

Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Why did you go and stay?
You'll get a lickin'
As sure as I'm sittin'
On this bale of hay

Bo Weevil, Weevil
Do do, do do, do do
Bo Weevil, Weevil
Do do, do do, do
