Hey! jealous lover
You're acting so strange
Hey! jealous lover
What is making you change

Hey! jealous lover
How wrong can you be
I'm yours ever faithful
Just be faithful to me

I am just as steady - as that clock on the shelf
Maybe you're accusing me of - what you're doing yourself

Hey! jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

Could have cheated lots of times - but just couldn't do
I was much to busy baby - being faithful to you

Hey! jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

- no one for me - jealous lover but you
