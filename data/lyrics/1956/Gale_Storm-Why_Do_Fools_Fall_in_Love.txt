Ooh-wah ooh-wah, ooh-wah ooh-wah,
Ooh-wah ooh-wah, why do fools fall in love

Why do birds sing so gay, and lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love, why do they fall in love

Love is a losing game, love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see, for that fool is me
Tell my why, tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay, and lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love, why do they fall in love

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat
For I know I will reach defeat
Tell me why, tell my why

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat
For I know it will reach defeat
Tell me why, tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay, and lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why, do fools...fall in love
