Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin' just for you

Need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me

Eenie meenie and miney-mo
Told me you'd'n't want me around no more
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love, you yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin' just for you

Eenie, meenie, and miney-mo
Told me you'd'n't want me around no more
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me
