I want your eyes to see my eyes
I want your lips to touch my lips
I want your love to be my love forever more 

Can you find it in your heart to forgive me
I was thoughtless heaven knows I acted badly
But the love I once gave to you so gladly
Can you find it in your heart

Can't we make another start, please forgive me
I'm repenting and your arms alone can save me
So if carelessly I lost the love you gave me
Can you find it in your heart

Day and night I want your eyes to see my eyes
I want your lips to touch my lips
I want your love to be my love forever more
And never never more to part

Must you tell me that it's over? think it over
Though I once betrayed your love, forgive the treason
And my darling if your mind can't find the reason
Can you find it in your heart
