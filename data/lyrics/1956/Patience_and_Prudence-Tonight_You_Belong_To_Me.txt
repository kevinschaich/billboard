I know (I know)
You belong - to somebody new
But Tonight you belong to me...
Although (Although)
We're apart - your part of my heart..
And tonight you belong to me...
Way down by the stream..
How sweet it will seem..
Once more just to dream
In the moonlight...
My honey I know...
With the dawn..that you will be gone..
But tonight you belong to me...
Way down way down along the stream..
How very very sweet it will seem..
Once more just to dream in the silvery moonlight...
My honey I know...
With the dawn..that you will be gone..
But tonight you belong to me...
Just to little old me...
