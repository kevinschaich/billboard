See you later, alligator…

Well, I saw my baby walking
With another man today
Well, I saw my baby walking
With another man today
When I asked her, "What's the matter?"
This is what I heard her say

See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now?
Don't you know you cramp my style?

When I though of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
When I though of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
But the next time that I saw her
Reminded her of what she said

See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now?
Don't you know you cramp my style?

She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you"
She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you
Won't you say that you'll forgive me
And say your love for me is true?"

I said, "Wait a minute, gator
I know you mean it just for play"
I said, "Wait a minute, gator
I know you mean it just for play
Don't you know you really hurt me
And this is what I have to say"

See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now?
Don't you know you cramp my style?

See you later, alligator
After awhile, crocodile
See you later, alligator
So long, that's all, goodbye…
