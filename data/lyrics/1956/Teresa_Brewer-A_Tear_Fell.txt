A fool am I, a fool am I, in love

A tear fell when I saw you in the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me all alone and feeling blue
A tear fell when you told me that your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops but I miss you constantly

A fool am I, a fool am I, in love

The teardrop that you stepped on as you danced across the floor
Were crushed like my poor heart was when you walked out of my door
A tear fell when you told me that the flame in your heart died
Darling have I lost you like these tear drops from my eyes

A fool am I, a fool am I, in love

A tear fell when you told me that your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops but I miss you constantly

A fool am I, a fool am I, in love
