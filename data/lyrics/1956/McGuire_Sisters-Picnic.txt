On a picnic morning
Without a warning
I looked at you
And somehow I knew

On a day for singing
My heart went winging
A picnic grove
Was our rendezvous

You and I in the sunshine
We strolled the fields and farms
At the last light of evening
I held you in my arms

Now when days grow stormy
And lonely for me
I just recall
Picnic time with you

Now when days grow stormy
And lonely for me
I just recall
Picnic time with you
