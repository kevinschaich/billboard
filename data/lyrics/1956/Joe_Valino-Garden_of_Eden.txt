When you walk in the garden
The garden of Eden
With a beautiful woman
And you know how you care

And the voice in the garder
The Garden of Eden
Tells you she is forbidden
Can you leave her there

When you're yearnin' for lovin'
And she touches your hand
And your heart starts in pounding
And you're feeling so grand

Can you lead her to heaven
And obey the commands
Can you walk from the garden
Does your heart understand

Can you leave her there
Can you leave her there
Can you leave her there
