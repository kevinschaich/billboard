Allegheny Moon I need your light
To help me find romance tonight
So shine, shine, shine
Allegheny Moon your silver beams
Can lead the way to golden dreams
So shine, shine, shine

High among the stars so bright above
The magic of your lamp of love can make him mine
Allegheny Moon it's up to you
Please see what you can do
For me and for my one and only love

Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine

High among the stars so bright above
The magic of your lamp of love can make him mine
Allegheny Moon it's up to you
Please see what you can do
For me and for my one and only love

Shine on me tonight, Allegheny Moon
