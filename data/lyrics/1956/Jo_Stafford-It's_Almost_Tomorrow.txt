My dearest, my darling, tomorrow is near
The sun will bring showers of sadness I fear
You lips won't be smiling, your eyes will not shine
For I know tomorrow that your love won't be mine

It's almost tomorrow, but what can I do
Your kisses all tell me that your love is untrue
I'll love you forever till stars cease to shine
And hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine

You heart was so warm dear, It now has turned cold
You no longer love me, for your memories grow old
It's almost tomorrow, for here comes the sun
But still I am hoping that tomorrow won't come

It's almost tomorrow, but what can I do
Your kisses all tell me that your love is untrue
I'll love you forever, till stars cease to shine
And hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine.
