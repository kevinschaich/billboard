(Clyde Otis, Kelly Owens)


Did you ever
Watch the one you love
Slowly drifting away from you,
And you know 
Deep in your heart
There is nothing that you can do
To make her stay (To make her stay),
To turn the tide (To turn the tide), 
To ease the pain (To ease the pain)
That you feel down inside?


When her eyes 
Say it's over and done,
Then you simply must face the fact.
So you leave and think it over,
But you come hurrying back
Hoping she'll change her mind,
Praying she'll take you back.
But like the lady said,
"That's all there is to that."
