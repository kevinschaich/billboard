Ooh, I'll wait for you

Oh, I know we both are young
And must wait till school is through
Ooh, I'll wait for you
(Ooh, I'll wait for you)

Oh, I tell my impatient heart
There is nothing I can do
Ooh, I'll wait for you
(Ooh)

There's one day I dream of
The day I can bring
My token of true love
Your engagement ring, I love you

So until the day I'll hear
You will say, yes, I do
Ooh, I'll wait for you
(Ooh, I'll wait for you)

There's one day I dream of
The day I can bring
My token of true love
Your engagement ring, I love you

So until the day I'll hear
You will say, yes, I do
Ooh, I'll wait for you
(Ooh, I'll wait for you)
