I used to play around with hearts 
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl 
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me 
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me
And that we'd never part
And so for the very first time 
I gave away my heart

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

The next day she was gone
And I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart 
And won her victory

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Well, I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play
Love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(Poor little fool)
