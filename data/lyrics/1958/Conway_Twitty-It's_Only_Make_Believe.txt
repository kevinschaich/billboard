People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes 
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)
