Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Come on baby, it's time to rock
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'm so happy I got you here
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
(Don't let go, don't let go)

Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go

Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Love is hummin' inside my brain
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin
(Don't let go, don't let go)
You been keepin' your lips from mine
(Don't let go, don't let go)

Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go

Hound dog barkin' upside the hill
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Love is draggin' him through the mill
(Don't let go, don't let go)
If it wasn't for havin' you
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'd be barkin' and hollerin' too
(Don't let go, don't let go)

Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go

One day baby, you'll cook me yet
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'll be hollerin', and soaken' wet
(Don't let go, don't let go)
One thing baby, I'll never stand
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Your lips kissin' some other man
(Don't let go, don't let go)

Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go

Just hold me tight
Just hold me tight
Just hold me tight
