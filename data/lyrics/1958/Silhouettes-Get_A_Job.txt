Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na, ba
Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Mum mum mum mum mum mum, get a job
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na

Every morning about this time
She get me out of my bed
A-crying get a job

After breakfast, everyday
she throws the want ads right my way
And never fails to say
Get a job

Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na, ba
Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Mum mum mum mum mum mum, get a job
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na

Whoa, and when I get the paper
I read it through and through
And my girl never fails to say
If there is any work for me

And then I go back to the house
Hear the woman's mouth
(Preaching and a-crying
Tell me that I'm lying about a job
That I never could find)

Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na, ba
Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Mum mum mum mum mum mum, get a job
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na

Well, when I get the paper
I read it through and through
And my girl never fails to say
If there is any work for me

And then I go back to the house
I hear the woman's mouth
(Preaching and a-crying
Tell me that I'm lying about a job
That I never could find)

Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na (ba doo)
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na, ba
Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Mum mum mum mum mum mum, get a job
Sha-na na-na, sha-na na-na na
