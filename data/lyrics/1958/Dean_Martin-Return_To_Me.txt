Return to me
Oh my dear I am so lonely
Hurry back, hurry back, oh my love
Hurry back, I'm yours

Return to me
For my heart wants you only
Hurry home, hurry home, won't you please
Hurry home to my heart?

My darling
If I've hurt you I'm sorry
Forgive me
And please say you are mine

Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back, hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart

Ritorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Solo tu, mi amor
