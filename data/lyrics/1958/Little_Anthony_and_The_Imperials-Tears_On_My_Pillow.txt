You don't remember me
But I remember you
Twas' not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (oooh, oooh)
(you, oooh oooh)

If we could start a new
I wouldnt hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (oooh, oooh)
(you, oooh oooh)

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

If we could start a new
I wouldnt hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (oooh, oooh)
(you, oooh oooh)

Ohh...
