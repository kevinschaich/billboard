Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah, at the hop

Well, you can rock it you can roll it
You can stop and you can stroll it at the hop
When the record starts spinnin'
You dance when you chicken at the hop
Do the dance sensation that is sweepin' the nation at the hop

Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (oh baby)
Let's go to the hop (oh baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop

Well, you can swing it you can groove it
You can really start to move it at the hop
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop
All the cats and chicks can get their kicks at the hop
Let's go!

Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (oh baby)
Let's go to the hop (oh baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop
Let's go!

Well, you can rock it you can roll it
You can stop and you can stroll it at the hop

You can really start to move it at the hop
