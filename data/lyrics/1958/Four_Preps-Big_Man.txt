I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
Well I talked big yesterday, but boy you oughta see me now
I bragged too long that your love was strong
There'd never be another guy
But you said more when you whispered your goodbye
I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now

I said that I was through with you
I didn't need you anyhow
I said I didn't need you then
But boy you oughta see me now

Those bragging words that you were mine
Of that there was no doubt
So empty now that half my life's walked out
Half my life left me yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

If you will just forgive me dear
I'll never break another vow
I broke so many yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

I couldn't see it yesterday
But now I know it's true
The only thing that made me big was you

I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
If you could only see me now
You should see me now
