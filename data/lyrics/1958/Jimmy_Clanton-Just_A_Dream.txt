Just a Dream
Jimmy Clanton
Just a dream, just a dream..(just a dream?)
All our plans and our all schemes  ( all our schemes?)
How could I think you'd be mine  ( you?d be mine?)
The lies I'd tell myself each time

I know that we could never last  ( never last?)
We just can't seem to in the past  ( in the past?) 
Just a dream I dream in vain  ( dream in pain?)
With you I'd only live in pain

Your picture is always with me
I can still hear that same mournful song
And now I sit here crying
Please leave me alone

Why , why do I love you ( I love you?)
How can I live in misery ( misery?)
I know that I won't forget you (forget you?)
But now I know it's too late for me
Your picture is always with me
I can still hear that same mournful song
And now I sit here crying
Please leave me alone

Why , why do I love you  ( I love you?)
How can I live in misery  ( misery?)
I know that I won't forget you  ( forget you?)
But now I know it's too late for me  ( too late?)
