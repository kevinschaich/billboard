Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will some day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will some way
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on, 
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man 
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on, 
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man 
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
