For your love, oh, I would do anything
I would do anything, for your love

For your kiss
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
Oh, I would go anywhere
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I would go
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
Anywhere, for your kiss

More foolish I grow
With each heart beat
But we all get foolish
That's why I repeat

For your love
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
Oh, I would do anything
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I would do anything, for your kiss

I would do anything, for your love
(Anything, anything, anything)
For your love
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ooh)
