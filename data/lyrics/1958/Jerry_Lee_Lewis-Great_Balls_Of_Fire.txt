You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me, honey
I've changed my mind 
Love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! 

Kiss me baby, mmm, it feels good
Hold me baby
Girl, just let me love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I'ma tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

Well, kiss me baby, ooh, it feels good
Hold me baby
I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I got to tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous 'cause it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

I said goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Hoo!
