When somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you...
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless she needs you
All the way

Through the good or lean years
And for all those in between years
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way

All the way...

So if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All.. The ... Way...
