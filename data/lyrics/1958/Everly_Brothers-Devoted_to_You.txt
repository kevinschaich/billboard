Darlin' you can count on me 
Till the sun dries up the sea 
Until then I'll always be devoted to you 

I'll be yours through endless time 
I'll adore your charms sublime 
Guess by now you know that I'm devoted to you 

I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie 
I'll never be untrue 
I'll never give you reason to cry 
I'd be unhappy if you were blue 

Through the years my love will grow 
Like a river it will flow 
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you 

I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie 
I'll never be untrue 
I'll never give you reason to cry 
I'd be unhappy if you were blue 

Through the years my love will grow 
Like a river it will flow 
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you
