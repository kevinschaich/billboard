If you knew Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
Without Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you, gal
Yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh, how my heart yearns for you
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you, gal
Yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, Peggy Sue
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you, gal
And I need you, Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you, gal
And I want you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, 
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, Peggy Sue
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you, gal
Yes, I need you, Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you, gal
And I want you, Peggy Sue

Oh well, I love you gal
And I want you Peggy Sue
