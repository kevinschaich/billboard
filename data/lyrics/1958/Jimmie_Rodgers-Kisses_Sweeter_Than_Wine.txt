Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed.
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again.

CHORUS:
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged and I pleaded like a natural man
And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand.

CHORUS

Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life.
We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin
And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins.

CHORUS

Well our children, they numbered just about four
And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door.
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight.

CHORUS

Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go
I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain
But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine.
