What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do.

What am longing for, each lonely night?
To feel your lips to mine and hold you tight.
You'll be my little girl my whole life through.
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do.

I want you close to me, that's all I know.
I want you all the time, cause darling I love you so.

What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do.
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do.
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do.
