I will love you any way
Even if you can not stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
Though you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy 

Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Whah oh sweet thing
Oh you know you're my everything
Yes you are

I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me baby
Don't walk away don't be so shady
Don't want your mind
Don't want your money
These words I say they may sound funny
But

Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Woah oh sweet thing 
Boy you know you're my everything
Yes you are

Yes you are

Ooh
You are my heat you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right 
Or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy you 
Though you're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I cant deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
