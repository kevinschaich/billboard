Just because you've become a young woman now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some guy for his hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me
You better shop around

There's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The men'll come and the men are gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me
You better shop around

Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Before you take a man and say I do now
Make sure he's in love with you now
Make sure that his love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now
My mama told me
You better shop around
