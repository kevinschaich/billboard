Woo!

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

I'm in the mood

Move to the music
We can roll all night

Oooh slow ride

Slow ride, take it easy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Woo!

I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night

Oooh

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Slow ride, easy, slow ride, sleazy
Slow ride, easy, slow ride, sleazy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Slow ride, take it easy

You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
You know the rhythm is right
