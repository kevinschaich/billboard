The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your okay
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right

We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smiling bright
I'll play the radio on Southern stations
'Cause Southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
A class of 7-4 gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right

We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
'Cause me and moon are itching to play
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right
