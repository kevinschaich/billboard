All alone at the end of the evening 
And the bright lights have faded to blue 
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have 
Loved me and I never knew 
You know I've always been a dreamer 
(spent my life running 'round) 
And it's so hard to change 
(Can't seem to settle down) 
But the dreams I've seen lately 
Keep on turning out and burning out 
And turning out the same 

So put me on a highway 
And show me a sign 
And take it to the limit one more time 

You can spend all your time making money 
You can spend all your love making time 
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow 
Would you still be mine? 

And when you're looking for your freedom 
(Nobody seems to care) 
And you can't find the door 
(Can't find it anywhere) 
When there's nothing to believe in 
Still you're coming back, you're running back,
You're coming back for more 

So put me on a highway 
And show me a sign 
And take it to the limit one more time 

Take it to the limit 
Take it to the limit 
Take it to the limit one more time
