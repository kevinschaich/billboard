Living in the city
Ain't never been my idea
Of getting it on
But the job demands
That you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone

You get a house in the hills
You're paying everyones bills
And they tell you that
You're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is that who you really are

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home

Talking on the telephone
Setting up another day
Of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street

When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is this what its all about

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home
