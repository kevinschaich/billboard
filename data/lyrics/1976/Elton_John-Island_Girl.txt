I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey so sweet
Down where Lexington 'cross 47th Street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standing six foot three
Turning tricks for the dudes in the big city

Island girl
What you wanting with the white man's world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world

He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's world

She's black as coal but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake, oh
He one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

Island girl
What you wanting with the white man's world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world

He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's world

Island girl
What you wanting with the white man's world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world

He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's
