Baby's into runnin' around, hangin' with the crowd
Puttin' your business in the street, talkin' out loud
Sayin' you bought her this and that and how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent

Hey, boy, you better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Taught her how to talk like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Gave her that big idea

Nothin' you can't handle, nothin' you ain't got
Put your money on the table and drive it off the lot
Turn on that old lovelight and turn a "Maybe" to a "Yes"
Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess

Hey son, better get back on to town
Face the sad old truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Put those ideas in your head
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

Yeah

Come on back down, little son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown!

You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old
Got to have a Jones for this, Jones for that
This runnin' with the Joneses, boy, just ain't where it's at, no, no

You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Got you thinking like that, boy
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, I wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown (I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown

(Ooohooohooohooo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who

Got you thinkin' like that, got you thinkin' just like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Lookin' that girl in the face is so sad
I'm ashamed of you

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
