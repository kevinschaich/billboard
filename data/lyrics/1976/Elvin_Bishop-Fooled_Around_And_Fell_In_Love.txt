I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free on my own, that's the way I used to be
But since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me

(Fooled around and fell in love) Whoo, it's got ahold on me now, yeah
(Fooled around and fell in love) I can't let go of you baby
(Fooled around and fell in love) I can't stop loving you now
(Fooled around and fell in love) Hey
'Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
Fooled around and fell in love
