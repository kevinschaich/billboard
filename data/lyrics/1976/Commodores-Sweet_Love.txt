Show me a river that's so deep
Show me a mountain so high
I'll show you love that'll last forever
Flying high, so high
Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers
And all the things you wish come true, yeah
I'd wish the world had all happy people
Then there'd be no more wishing to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sweet)
Sweet love (Sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Well, well)
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh?well
Sweet love
Sweet love that comes through the ages
Reach out and touch my soul
Gave my life so much meaning
And everyone a heart of gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
(Oh, you needed love)
(Ooh?hoo?)
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love (Sweet love, well)
I know you're searchin'
I know you're searchin' for a little love
A little peace and understandin'
And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way
But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day
'Cause it's love, love's the only way
(Oh, nothin' but love)
Oh?oh? (Love)
Sweet love (Sweet love, ow)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (When you're down and out and you can't see your way)
Sweet love (And you need a friend, well-ell-ell)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Just call on love, love)
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
