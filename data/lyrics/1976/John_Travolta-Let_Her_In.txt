I'm different today, hey-hey
Somethin' she said has stuck in my head
And I can't get away

Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life

You know what I find, I find
A look at her face and there isn't a trace
Of doubt in my mind

Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my life

Gonna open up
After so long
Gonna open up
After so long
With my feet stuck on the ground
And my head against the wall
I've been called

And I can't answer why, why-hy
Somethin' inside and it can't be denied
And I'm ready to try

Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life

Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my life

Gonna let her in, woah-woah
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my li-fe

Gonna let her in, woah-woah
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my li-fe
