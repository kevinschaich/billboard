(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do, huh
And it's not that I've found someone 
To take the place of you
It's just to feel the feel with in me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand

So I'm leaving (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love
Breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooh you're clinging to me tighter 
Than you ever have before, I don't understand it 
And I know it's gonna take everything I've got
To keep walking out the door
But those arms you've got around me 
Will let me go some day
And I'd rather leave you holding on
Than pushing me away  

So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love
Breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooh baby

It's not that I don't love you (I'm gonna walk away from love
You know how much I do (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
Oh baby (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

I'm leaving baby,
this time i'mplaying it smart (I'm gonna walk away from love
Oh don't break my heart, (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
I'll walk away, baby (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oooohh!
