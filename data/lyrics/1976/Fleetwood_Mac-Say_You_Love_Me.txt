Have mercy baby,
On a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling falling,
Falling at your feet.

I'm tingling right,
From my head to my toes,
So help me help me,
Help me make the feeling grow.

'Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Have pity, baby, just,
When I thought it was over,
And now you got me runnin', runnin',
Runnin' for cover.

I'm begging you for, a bit of
Sympathy,
If you use me again,
It'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Baby, baby hope,
You're gonna stay away,
'Cause I'm getting weaker,
Weaker every day.

I guess I'm not as strong,
As I used to be,
If you use me again,
It'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Say that you love me,
Say that you love me,
Say that you love me.

Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin'.
