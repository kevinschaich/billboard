I - don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
O.K. - you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F - foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away

You - you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand (second hand)
I've heard it all before
I - don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F - foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away

F - foxy
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F - foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away
Fox on the run
Fox on the run
Fox on the run...
