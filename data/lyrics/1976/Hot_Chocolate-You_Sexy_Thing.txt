I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly?
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know, every night and day for?
Every day, needing love as satisfaction
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Oh, kiss me, you sexy thing
Touch me, baby, you sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling, you sexy thing
Oh, it's ecstasy, you sexy thing

Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you

Kiss me, darling
