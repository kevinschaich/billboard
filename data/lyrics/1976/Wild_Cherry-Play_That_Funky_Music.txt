Hey
Do it now
Yeah, hey

Hey, yeah, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burnin' down the one night stands

And everything around me, yeah
Got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, yeah, yeah

Well, I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?

So still I kept on fightin'
Well, loosin' every step of the way
I said, "I must go back there", got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die

Till you die, oh, till you die
Come on, play some electrified funky music

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and rollin' minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind

Oh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funkin' out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin', no I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, oh till you die

(They shouted, play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Got to keep on, play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Wanna take ya higher now

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music honky
Play that funky music
