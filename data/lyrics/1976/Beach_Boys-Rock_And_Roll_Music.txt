Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change  the beauty of the melody
Until it sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks a-dancin' got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old way you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Say if you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
It's gotta be some of that
If you wanna dance with me
