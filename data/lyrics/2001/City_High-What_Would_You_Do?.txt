Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: "Everyday I wake up hoping to die"

She said: "Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to"

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?

No, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the record, yo, stop the record!
Yo, Shorty, you ain't gotta be goin' out like this, man!
(Holdup)

(What would you do?)
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through

(Come on, what would you do?)
Get up on my feet and stop makin' tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Girl, I know if my mother could do it, baby, you can do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
