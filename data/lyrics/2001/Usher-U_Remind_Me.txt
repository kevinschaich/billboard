Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute
But I got something to tell ya, listen

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while

See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through (oh no no no)
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (gotta let you go)

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (oh, wouldn't believe)
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (oh no)
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (baby, I'm sorry, I gotta let you go)
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (you remind me of a girl that I once knew)

You remind of a girl that I once knew
