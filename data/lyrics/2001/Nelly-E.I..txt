I'ma sucka for corn rows and manicured toes (hey) 
Fendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright) 
Passadity ?? city, with one or two throws 
I'm droppin 'em outta high school straight into the pros 
Who knows? I know! 
And I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows 
And break it down low to the flo', and there you go 
Now throw it on me slow 
And everytime I Bust a rhyme, baby "Gimme Some Mo'" 
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind 
And I'll be right back; yeah that's my very next line 
I use it - time after time, when I'm speakin my mind 
It's no matter if I'm shootin game to a pigeon or dime 
I ask her, "Who dat is, talkin that shit about the 'tics?" 
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit 
But ain't nobody else droppin shit like this 
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, HEY!

Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me

In the black SS with the naviga-tion 
See the joint blaz-on, somethin smells amaz-on 
I got a chick rollin up, half black and asi-an 
Another one pidge-on, tellin me to come home 
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone 
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers 
From +Phat Farm+ to +Iceberg Slim+ in one shower 
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit the P hours 
Kicked the bitch up out the room cause she used the word ours, HEY!

Aiyyo I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky 
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin icky 
Let go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky 
Start frontin when the shows out - whatchu mean?! 
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut - come and get me 
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut - is you wit me? 
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut 
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut 
Then I slide up in the Escalade 
Me and E gettin solid like the Ice Capades 
And me and Heezy - frosty, project mo' wrapped up than Bugsy 
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies 
If you compare me to your local grocery 
Then you'll see I got more carrots/karats than "Aisle D" 
More bread than "Aisle G", then bag and scan me 
+Sure+ like +Al B.+, meet the 'tics in Maui, HEY!
