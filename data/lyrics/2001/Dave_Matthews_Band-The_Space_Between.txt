You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between
