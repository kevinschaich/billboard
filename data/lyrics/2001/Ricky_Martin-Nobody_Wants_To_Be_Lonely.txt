Why, why, why

Oh ooh ohh

There you are, in a darkened room
And you're all alone, looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand in the shadows

In the shadows

Come to come, come to me

Can't you see that...? 

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why), why don't you let me love you?

Why (ooh ohh yeah), why (oh why), why

Ooh ooh, yeah
Can you hear my voice, do you hear my song?
It's a seranade, so your heart can find me, ohh
And suddenly you're flying down the stairs
Into my arms, baby, ohh

Before I start going crazy

Going crazy, ohh

Run to me

Run to me

Cause I'm dying...

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry (I don't wanna cry)
My body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why

Why, why don't you let me love you?

I wanna feel you need me

Feel you need me

Just like the air you're breathing

Breathing, I need you here in my life

Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk alway, don't walk away
No, no, no, no...

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry...yeah yeah

Nobody wants to be lonely (yeah ohh ooh)
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry)
My body's longing to hold you (is longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside (hurts inside)
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why), why don't you let me love you?
Let me love you...

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry...)
My body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside (so hurt inside)
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why), why don't you let me love you?

Why (why), let me love you
Why don't you let me love you
Why, love you, let me love you

Why (why)
