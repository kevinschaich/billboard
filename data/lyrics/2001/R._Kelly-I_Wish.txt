I wish, I wish, I wish
(To every city,every hood and every block)
I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America)
I wish, I wish, I wish,
I wish, I wish, I wish

Rollin' through the hood 
Just stopped to say what's up
And let you know your baby boy aint doin' so tough
Even though you passed 
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night cryin' tears
just thinkin' about those days
You used to talk to me 
Smilin' while I'm sippin'on this Hennessy
And remember we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs 
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know 
the half
I would give it all up just to take on ride with you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say
Boy,you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man,I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me
shootin' this real shit off like a gun
Mmmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a
Bentley and a house 
That's why
Fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass player get a real player hatin'em
"Honey Love" goes platinum and y'all ass come 'round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs 
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride with you 
How I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn...my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head
Be tellin' me to come to church
Say the lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt 
Dreaming of windows
Black-tinted like a hearse
But waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man 
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride 
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you and how I'd go to church on
Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
