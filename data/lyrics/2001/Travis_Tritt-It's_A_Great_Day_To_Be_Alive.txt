I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been 15 years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in teh mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive


I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
