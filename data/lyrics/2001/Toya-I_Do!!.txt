He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' everytime he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)
