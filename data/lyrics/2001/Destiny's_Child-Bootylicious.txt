Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyoncé, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this

Barely move, we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
Baddest chick, chick inside
DJ Gemini

Spotted me, attentive thang
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna dance with me
Can you handle, handle me?

You gotta do much better
If you gonna dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you gonna dance with me tonight

Read my lips carefully if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can handle me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this

I'm about to break you off
H-Town going hard
Lead my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes

Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

Move your body up and down (whoo)
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo)
I can't help but wonder why (whoo)
Is my vibe too vibealacious for you, babe?

I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have 
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, baby
