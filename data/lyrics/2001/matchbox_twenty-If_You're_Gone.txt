I think I've already lost you (lost you)
I think you're already gone (gone)
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Oh, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need
More than you mind

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life
I think I'm just scared
That I know too much
I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move, yeah
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Aw, come home
There's a little bit of something me in everything in you

I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need (need)
This in my life and
And I think I'm scared
Do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

If you're gone
Then maybe it's time to come home
Well, there's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
Yeah, well if you're gone
Hell, baby you need to come home
Oh, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

Something me
Everything in you
Something me
In you
