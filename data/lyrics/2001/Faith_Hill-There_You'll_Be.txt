When I think back on these times,
And the dreams we left behind,
I'll be glad cause I was blessed to get,
To have you in my life,

When I look back on these days,
I look and see your face,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you, 
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
and everywhere I am there you'll be,

Well you showed me how it feels,
To feel the sky within my reach,
And I always will remember all,
The strength you gave to me,
Your love made me make it through,
Ohh I owe so much to you,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you, 
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
and everywhere I am there you'll be,

Cause I always saw you in my light, my strength,
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways,
You were right there for me, you were right there for me
you were right there for me,
For always

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you, 
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
and everywhere I am there you'll be,
