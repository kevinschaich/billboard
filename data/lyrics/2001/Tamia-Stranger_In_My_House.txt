I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspence is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoes
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

1 - There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
U leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell

So what could it be?
Is there someone immitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say...

Repeat 1

Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same

Repeat 1 to fade
