Let me be your hero. (Whisper) 

Would you dance
if I asked you to dance?
Would you run
And never look back?
Would you cry
If you saw me cryin'?
And would you save my soul tonight?

Would you tremble
If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this.
Now, would you die
For the one you love?
Hold me in your arms tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

Would you swear
That you'll always be mine?
Would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

Oh, I just wanna hold you.
I just wanna hold you, oh yeah.

Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care, you're here tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain, oh yeah.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

You can take my breath away.

I can be your hero.
