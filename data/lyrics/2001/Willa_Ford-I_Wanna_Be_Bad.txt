Oh

I wanna be bad witchu, baby
I, I, I, I
I wanna be bad witchu, baby

Do you
Understand what I need, need
From you
Just let me be the girl to show
You, you
Everything that you can be
Is everything that I can be
(I wanna be) My turn
Let me let you know that I,
I can't promise that I won't do that
So, boy
Say the time and place
'cause you make me wanna misbehave

.::Chorus::.
I wanna be bad (bad)
You make bad look so good
I've got things on my mind
I never thought I would
I, I wanna be bad (bad)
You make bad feel so good
I'ma losing all my cool
I'm about to break the rules
I, I wanna be bad

I wanna be bad witchu, baby
I, I, I, I, (with you yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I wanna be bad witchu, baby

What's up?
Tell me what to do, how to be
Teach me
All your words from A to Z
But I
Don't want your other girl to see
That you're messing 'round with me, no
Should I boy
Tell ya what I got is what ya want
Tell, tell me, do I, I turn you on?
I don't want no one judging me

You make bad look so good - ooh ooh, no no no
