It's the S the L the I the M
Let me tell you what I wanna do,
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna freak,wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken enough of you
So sweet, so very wet 
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

Peaches and Cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and Cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby, right next to you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In front, in the back of you
Ohh I love the smell of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream 

Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got you arms around my neck and I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A'-shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach is it
Put your hands in the air and represent your c***

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better with ice cream
Know what I mean, Peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it here
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it here
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean

I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better with ice cream
