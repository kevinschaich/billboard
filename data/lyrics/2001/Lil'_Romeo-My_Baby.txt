Gotta Uncle named Silkk and a Uncle named C
I been dribbling the ball since the age of 3
I got game like Coby, dunk it like Poppa P
Once I'm in the zone ain't no stoppin' me

them Miller boyz wear No Limit gear from head to feet

(Bridge:)
It's like that whodi (you got me crazy)
It's like that whodi (I want to be your lady)
It's like that whodi (why won't you be my baby)
It's like that whodi (can't no girl fade me)
meet me at the skatin rink

(Chorus)

(Lil' Romeo)
11 years old, makin' A's and B's
and these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
when you see me in the streets holla "what's up doc?"
I gotta a bugs bunny chain wit a matchin' watch
I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife
I got grown women wanna be in my life
by the time I reach 18 I'm not gon be nothin' nice
I'm that R-O-M-E-O, and after high school 
I'm goin' straight to the pro's bounce,bounce

(Chorus)

(Girl singing)
Soldier boy I want u to myself
I don't want them girls around
Your the flyest thing up in here boy
and that's why it's goin down
I heard they call you Romeo 
Well I'm your Julliet
u must be playin hide and seek
cause boy ur hard to catch

(Chorus)

(oh Romeo)
why you boys make them elbows swing 
why you girls make them elbows swing
(repeat 9x's)

Romeo gonna do dat thang, Romeo gonna do dat thang
Romeo gonna do dat thang, Romeo gonna do dat thang
