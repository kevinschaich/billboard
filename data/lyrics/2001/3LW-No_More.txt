I'm getting a little tired
Of your broken promises, promises
Lookin' at your pager
Seein' different numbers, numbers
Call you and you say
You're hangin' with the fellas, fellas
Hangin' with my girls
You always gettin' jealous, jealous

I was with you when 
You didn't have no dollas, no dollas
Hangin' at the crib
Chillin' with your momma, your momma
Never fronted you
Never brought the drama, the drama
Now you wanna flip
Playa, please

No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, say it again, oh)
No, I'm not the one
(You do or you don't)

(1) - You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more
No more, baby I'ma do right

You can or you can't, can't
Be a man, be a man, man
No more
No more, baby I'ma do right

You treat me like a lady
When you open doors, doors
But then you wanna front
When you're with your boys, your boys
How you gonna play me
When I bought your clothes, your clothes
The ones that you be wearin'
When you with your doe's, your doe's

I know you never thought
That I would have the nerve, the nerve
Think about it more
Since you at the curb, the curb
Blowin' up my pager
Say you want a chance, a chance
Listen when I say
Playa, please

(Repeat 1)

(2) - No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'ma do right, do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'ma do right, do right)

(Repeat 2)

I just wanna know
What happened to our love
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong
When you gonna see
How good it is with me
I'm tired and all through
With all your listen baby

(Rap)
Hey yo you promised me Kate Spade
But that was last year boy in the 8th grade
But you ain't Biggie baby boy, so no it ain't 'one more chance'
And when yo friends around you don't wanna hold my hand
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix
Hoppin' out the whips the whips the five and six
Yes fly crone, so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter go call Tyrone

(Repeat 1)

(Repeat 2)
(Repeat 2)

No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)

No, I'm not the one
(I could do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)

(Repeat 1 to fade)
