While he was schemin'
I was leanin' in the Beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neeman Marcus on a shopping spree, ah
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 

(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) There goes the house we made a home
(Oops) There goes you'll never leave me alone
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you betta let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just a-draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) There goes the house we made a home
(Oops) There goes you'll never leave me alone
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild

All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days
When we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is better than money, you see

Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and

If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
