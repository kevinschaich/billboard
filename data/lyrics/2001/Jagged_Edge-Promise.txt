Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
And everything will be all right
I, I promise these things to you
Girl just believe, I promise

Should've known the things you say been right
Forever's such a very long time
We never even had a fight
Don't let no one change your mind
'Cause they don't know how much I care
They don't know the things we share unless they here babe
But since they're not
How can they say that I'm not true, oh, oh, oh

If you need a love, I got the love that you need
Ain't no way that they can take that from me
And I pray to God one day they will see

They'll see that I'm all that you need, oh

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go (oh baby)
Baby, I promise that I'll stay true (I'll stay true)
Don't let nobody say it ain't so (don't let nobody say it ain't so)
And baby I promise 
That I will never leave (and)
And everything will be all right, I (all right, all right, I)
I promise these things to you
Girl, just believe
I promise

When I think of all the times I said
That I'll see you another day
Baby now that's gonna change, yes it is
Said you mean the world to me
And baby girl I'll keep you first, yeah
'Cause that's the kind of love you deserve
And you know I got a love if you need a love, yeah

If you need a love, I got the love that you need (oh yeah)
Ain't no way they can take that from me (ain't no way I'm gonna let them take it)
And I pray to God one day they will see
And I swear to you, 'cause I promise, oh girl

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go (why will we let this thing go, oh yeah)
Baby, I promise that I'll stay true 
Don't let nobody say it ain't so (don't let nobody say it ain't so)
And baby, I promise (baby, I promise, yeah)
That I will never leave (I will never leave you) 
And everything will be all right, I (girl, it's gonna be all right, yeah)
I promise these things to you
Girl, just believe (girl, believe)
I promise (in me)

You're the only one I want in my life ('cause you're the only one I want in my life)
