You know, I don't know what it is
But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
It makes weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I meant to say no...

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe,
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
(oh, oh, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself falling (falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't wanna play no game (No)
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no...

But he's Irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual (oh oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Baby you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful
He's so Irresistible (He's so irresistible)

But he's irresistible (yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (oh yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical 
Deeper than spiritual (oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

He's irresistible
Up close and personal (yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (Irresistible to me)
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me...
