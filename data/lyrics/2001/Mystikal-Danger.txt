You know what time it is nigga, 
and you know who the fuck this is. DANGER! 
DANGER! Get on the floor! The nigga right chea! Sing it!

Chorus:
Been so long (sing it!)
Since, he's been on
So please (get on the floor!)
Show me (the nigga right chea!)
What it is that you want to see

(Mystikal:)
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keepin' you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shit off, showing they tattoos, 
screamin, and hollerin' and all
Got the gift to come up with it,
put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on!
Sharp! Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins
They dive like dolphins
I'm the ???? lyrical marvel ??????? officer
Watch yourself!
Or fuck around and get beside yourself
I know! Go ahead though
Bounce them titties, shake ya ass, drop that pussy
Stay in line hoe
Fuck a think, cuz you can can
Cocked up, head down, pussy poppin' on a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking
If you gonna lose something
Then bend over, and bust that pussy open

Chorus x 2

(Mystikal)
My fuckin' concert line around the corner
Parking cars, niggas lookin' for they bitch, nothing on her!
You lookin' good momma
Why? Pshh, what's up homie?
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner
Ya bitch you!
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch
Cuz it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough!
I'm backstage bouncing
Adrenalin building up!
The pussy cutter
Did I stutter?
The heart flooder
Make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly
Hype like "Belly"
The rhyme seller!
Kick ass like Jim Kelly!
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it
Then bitch come on down!
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit
Then BITCH THAT'S WHAT IT IS!

Chorus x 2

DANGER!

Motherfucker look!
Get on the floor!
The nigga right chea!
DANGER!

DANGER!
(Look look) Nigga what! (look look)
Get on the floor! 
The nigga right chea!
Get 'em up!!!

Chorus x 2
