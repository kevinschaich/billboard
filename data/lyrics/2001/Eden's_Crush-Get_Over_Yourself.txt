Uh huh, Yeaheee yeah, Get over,
Get over, (listen)
Yeah I was right there - like the "little wife"
I was everything that you need - always in line
I was livin' you-lovin' you-filling your desires
(that's right)
But that was then-this is now-look me in the eyes

Oh oh oh oh - if love could choose sides
Oh oh oh oh - it's taking mine, so 

Get over yourself-goodbye(goodbye)
It must be hard to be you -yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything-everything-everything is all right
Get over yourself-know why(know why)
Cause without you see i do anything i like
Sometimes i stay out all night
And everything -everything-everything is all right

This just can't be it I kept telling myself
And every magazine said was me was on the shelf
I was givin out giving in giving away my dreams(thats right)
you put it in put me down now i found my
self-esteem and
Oh, oh
You Won't get me back,(won't get me back) no
Ya think I overreact-(overreact) o yeah
Oh oh oh 

Chorus

So now you wanna talk
Say let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times make up
Better yet-just forget-better get over yourself

So stay in touch
When you learn a few things about love (tell me baby)
until then, wake up
Better yet-better get-better get over yourself
(uh o-oooohh)

Get over yourself, goodbye (over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye (over yourself, goodbye)(always the 1 2 cry)
Over yourself, over yourself(everysingle night)

Get over yourself, goodbye
Cuz without you, see I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything, everything is alright!

Get over yourself-goodbye (goodbye)
It must be hard to be you-yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry (always the one to cry)
Now everything-everything-everything is all right
(get over yourself baby)
Get over yourself-know why (know why)
Cause without you see I do anything I like (I do anything I want)
Sometimes I stay out all night (all night)(yeah baby)
And everything-everything-everything is all right

Get over yourself-goodbye (goodbye)
It must be hard to be you-yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry (to cry)
Now everything-everything-everything is all right
Get over yourself-know why (get over yourself)
Cause without you see I do anything I like (I do anything I want)
Sometimes I stay out all night (anything I want)
And everything-everything-everything is all right (anything I want)

Get over yourself goodbye
Everything is all right, everything is all right
Get over yourself, get over yourself-goodbye
Everything is all right, everything is all right, get over yourself
Get over yourself goodbye
