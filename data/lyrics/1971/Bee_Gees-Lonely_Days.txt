Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.
Come sit beside me in your way.
I see you every morning, outside the restaurants,
The music plays so nonchalant.

Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?

Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.
Come sit beside me in your way.

Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?
