I won't ever leave
If you want me to stay
Nothing you could do
That could turn me away

Hanging on anyway
Believing the things you say
Being the fool

You've taken my life
So take my soul
That's what you said
And I believed it all

I want to be with you 
Long as you want me to
But don't move away

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?

Liar
Liar, liar

We have seen no night
We have seen no day
If I ever leave
Would you want me to stay?

You can believe in me
I won't be leaving
I won't let you go

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?

Liar
Liar, liar
Liar

You've taken my life
So take my soul
That's what you said
But who are we to know?

I want to be with you 
Long as you want me to
But don't move away

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?

Liar
Liar, liar
