Left a good job in the city

Working for the man ev'ry night and day

Then I never lost a minute of sleep
When worrying 'bout the way that things
Might have been.

Big wheels keep on turning.
Proud Mary keeps on burning.
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river.

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis.
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans.
But I never saw the good side of the city

'til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen.

Big wheels keep on turning.
Proud Mary keeps on burning.
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river.

If you come down to the river

Betcha gonna find the people who live

You don't have to worry though you have no money.
People on the river are happy to give.

Big wheels keep on turning.
Proud Mary keeps on burning.
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river.
