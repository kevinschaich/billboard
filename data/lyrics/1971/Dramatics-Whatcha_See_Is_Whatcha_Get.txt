Some people are made of plastic 
And you know some people are made of wood 
Some people have hearts of stone 
Some people are up to no good 

But baby, I'm for real 
I'm as real as real can get 
If what you're looking for is real loving 
Then what you see is what you get 

What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I said, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)
And the real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet)

You know some people are made of lies 
To bring you down and shame your name 
But baby, I have good intentions 
'Cause breaking hearts just ain't my game 

All I want to do is love you 
And sugar, I won't fill you with regret, no, no
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get

What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I mean, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)
And the real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet)
