Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears

You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird
Gonna fly right out of here
Without a single word
But you know you'll break my heart
When I watch you close that door
'Cause I know I won't see you anymore

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears

Haven't I been good to you
What about that brand new ring
Doesn't that mean love to you
Doesn't that mean anything
If I threw away my pride
And I got down on my knees
Would you make me beg you pretty please

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears

There's so much I wanna do
I've got love enough for two
But I'll never use it, girl, if I don't have you

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears 

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
