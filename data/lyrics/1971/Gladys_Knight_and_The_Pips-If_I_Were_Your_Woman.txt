If I were your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out that door
My love would over rule my sense 
And I'd call you back for more

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
And you were my man

Yeah
She tears you down Darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up Darling
When she lets you fall
You're like a diamond 
And she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
With me you don't ask

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never no, no, no stop loving you

Yeah
Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she came first 
Will she hang on your heart
You're a part of me
And you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, no, no, no stop loving you

If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
If I were your woman
You're sweet lovin' woman

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman...

...you'd need no other woman
