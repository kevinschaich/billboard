Ooh, ooh

Each day through my window, I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy."
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me, ooh
Oooohhhhhhh, (So)

(So) So we'll be married and raise a family (oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die

Mmm, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

Just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
Oh, tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me (I'll never get her, but I can't forget her)

Just my imagination (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
