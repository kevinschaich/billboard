Here comes that rainy day feeling again,
And soon my tears will be falling like rain.
It always seems to be a Monday,
Leftover memories of Sunday
Always spent with you.
Before the clouds appeared,
And took away my sunshine.

Here comes that rainy day feeling again,
And I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain.
Your face is always on my mind, girl
I'm hoping you're soon gonna find, girl
Your way back to me
'Cause if you'll say you'll stay
The rainy days will go away...

 Misty morning eyes,
I'm trying to disguise the way I feel.
But I just can't hide it.
People seem to know,
The loneliness will show.
I'm thinking of my pride
But breaking up inside, girl.

Whoa-oa-oa, here comes that rainy day feeling again.
And soon my tears,
they will be falling like rain.
It always seems to be a Monday.
Left over memories of Sunday,
Always spent with you,
Before the clouds appeared, and took away my sunshine.
Here comes that rainy day feeling again.
Here comes that rainy day feeling again.
Here comes that rainy day feeling again...
