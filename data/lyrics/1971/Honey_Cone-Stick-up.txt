Help! I've been robbed!
Stick-up, highway robbery
Stole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny
Stick-up, highway robbery
It's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree

He walked into my life hungry for love
So sweet and cautiously he chased my love
A devil in disguise, he fooled my heart
Tricked me into the dark, "HOLD UP!!"--I was shocked
Pulled his charms, took me in his arms
Stole my love, and now he's gone

Stick-up, highway robbery
Stole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny
Stick-up, highway robbery
It's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree

A thief in the night, he stole my mind
Breaking lover's hearts should be a crime
But he'll return to the scene of the crime
I'll set a tender trap, he'll be unaware
I'll wear a smile down the aisle
'Cause he's the father of my child

Stick-up, highway robbery
Stole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny
Stick-up, highway robbery
It's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree

(Boom-boom, shakalaka, boom-boom-boom-boom)
Help! I've been robbed!
Stick-up, highway robbery
