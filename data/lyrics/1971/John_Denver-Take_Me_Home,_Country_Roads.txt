Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road, I get a feelin
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads
