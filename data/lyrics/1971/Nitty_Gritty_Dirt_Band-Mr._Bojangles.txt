I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you 
In worn out shoes 
Silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe 
He jumped so high, he jumped so high 
And then he'd lightly touch down 

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was 
Down and out 
He looked to me to be the eyes of age 
As the smoke ran out 
He talked of life, he talked of life 
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped 

He said his name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick 
Across the cell 
He grabbed his pants, and favorite stance, oh, he jumped so high 
And then he clicked his heels 
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh 
Shook back his clothes all around 

Mr. Bojangles

Mr. Bojangles 
Dance 

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs 
Throughout the south 
He spoke through tears of fifteen years, how his dog and him 
Traveled about 
The dog up and died, he up and died 
After twenty years he still grieves 

He said, "I dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
For drinks and tips 
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit"
He shook his head, and as he shook his head 
I heard someone ask him please, please 

Mr. Bojangles
