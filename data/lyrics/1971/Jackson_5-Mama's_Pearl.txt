(Bum, bum, bum, bum) 
You send cold chills 
Up and down my spine 
We kiss for thrills 
Then you draw the line 
Oh baby 

'Cause your mama told you 
That love ain't right 
But don't you know 
Good lovin' is the spice of life Yeah 

(Chorus) 
Mama's pearl, let down those curls 
Won't you give my love a whirl 
Find what you been missin' 
Ooh, ooh, now baby 
Goody girl, let down those curls 
Let me give your heart a twirl 
Don't keep me wishing 

(Bum, bum, bum, bum) 
You want my lovin' yes you do, do, do 
You know my lovin' is true, true, true 
Now baby 

But your conscience tells you 
That love is wrong 
But just a little lovin' never hurt no one, oh 

(Chorus) 
Let all it hang (Girl, don't be afraid) 
(Oh, we've got the first step made) 
(Ooh, the rest is up to you) 
(Here is what to do) 
(Let yourself go) 

Let yourself just oh now, now no 
Let your lovin' go now, now 
Just give it to me 
('Cause I got what you need) 
I got what you need 
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love 

find out what you're missin' 
Goody girl lay down your curls 
Let me give your heart a twirl 

Why don't you give my love a whirl (Girl, don't be afraid) 
(Oh, we've got the first step made) 
(Ooh, just give it, just give it to me) 
('Cause I got what you need) 
Got what you need 
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love) 
(Let's yourself go) 

Let yourself just oh now, now no 
Let your lovin' go now, now 
Just give it to me 
('Cause I got what you need) 
Oh, mama's pearl 
(Girl, don't be afraid) 
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love) 
(Daddy's girl we've got it made) 
I know what you been missin', sugar! 
Goody, goody, goody girl, ooh
