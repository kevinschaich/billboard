If you could read my mind, love,
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet.
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

If I could read your mind, love,
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel,
The kind the drugstores sell,
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me,
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take.

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script.
Enter number two,
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me,
But for now, love, let's be real.
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back.

If you could read my mind, love,
What a tale my thoughts could tell,
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet.
But stories always end,
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack.
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back.
