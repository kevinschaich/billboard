I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd have never ending love for you

I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd have a never ending love for you

After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Feel for each other
From now on

It's so good I can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you

do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do....

After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Feel for each other
From now on

It's so good I can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you

I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you
