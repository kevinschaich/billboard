Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell

Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know

Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways

Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know
