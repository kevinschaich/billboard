One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy

But all I do is cry
(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go)
Since he left my life's so empty

Though I try to forget it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

'Cause I still love him so
I spend each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out
One less man to pick up after

No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away
(He went away, one less bell to answer)
Why did he leave me?
(Why, why, why did he leave?)

Now I've got one less egg to fry
(One less bell to answer)
One less egg to fry
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
And all I do is cry
(One less bell to answer)

Because a man told me goodbye
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
(One less bell to answer)
Somebody tell me please
Where did he go, why did he go?
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
How could he leave me?
