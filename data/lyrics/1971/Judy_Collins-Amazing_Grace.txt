Amazing grace! How sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found, 
Was blind, but now can see. 

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
And grace my Fears relieved; 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed! 

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come; 
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, 
And grace will lead me home. 

And when we've been there ten thousand years, 
Bright shining as the sun, 
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun.
