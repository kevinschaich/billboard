Last night, I turned out the light, lay down and thought about you
I thought about the way that it could be
Two o'clock, wonderin' what I'm doin' here alone without you
so I close my eyes and dream you here to me, and

CHORUS:  
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind

Hello, girl, yes it's five o'clock I know but you just listen


there's something that I've got to let you know
yes it's you, you're this pillow that I'm huggin' and I'm kissin'
and one more thing before I let you go

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
Do dreams come true, well if they do, I'll have you
Not just for a night, but for my whole life through

CHORUS

REPEAT AND FADE
