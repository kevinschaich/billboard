She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's given me a new born birth
I found sweetness on this bitter earth
She knows the things to say
To help my troubles away
And when the words she say won't do
She'll try a kiss or two
And if her kisses fail to move me
She'll take a little time to soothe me
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to console me
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to control me
I don't want nobody talking 'bout my baby
Nobody talkin 'bout my baby
I never thought I'd find another
Who gave me more love than my own mother
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no

She taught me the meaning of giving
She brought me back from the dead to the living
From a one room dirty shack
She washed the clothes on my back
She's got electrifying lovin'
As warm as a mother's oven
Don't know where she gets the power
Her lovin' gets strong by the hour
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to console me
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to control me
Listen she's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no

She's give me a new born birth
I found sweetness on this bitter earth
She's been just as close as a sister or a brother
She's done things for me
I couldn't ask of my own father
I believe her love would stretch
From one end of this earth to the other
Let me tell you she's not just another woman
