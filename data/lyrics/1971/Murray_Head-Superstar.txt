Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did
Get so out of hand
You'd have managed better
If you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward time
And such a strange land?

If you'd come today
You could have reached the whole nation
Israel in 4 B.C. had no mass communication

Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)

Only want to know (Only want to know)
Only want to know (Only want to know)
Only want to know (Only want to know)
Only want to know (Only want to know)

Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ, Superstar
Do you think you're what they say you are?

Do you think you're what they say you are?

Tell me what you think
About your friends at the top
Now who d'you think besides yourself
Was the pick of the crop?
Buddha was he where  it's at?
Is he where you are?
Could Muhammad move a mountain
Or was  that just PR?
Did you mean to die like that?
Was that a mistake or
Did you know your messy death
Would be a record breaker?

(Don't you get me  wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me  wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong

(Only want to know) Only want to  know
(Only want to know, now) Only want to know
(Only want to know) Only  want to know
(Only want to know, now) I only want to know

Jesus  Christ, Jesus Christ
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ,  Jesus Christ
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?

Do you think you're what they say you are?
