Sometimes we walk, hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air.
You turn to me, with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare.
Then your lips cling to mine, it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.

Sometimes we stand, on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky.
I turn to you, and you melt in my arms
Here we are, Darling, only you and I.
What a moment to share, it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.

The world is full of wondrous things, it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you.

Some quiet evening, I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own.
I feel the glow of your arms open love
I'm aware of the treasure that I hold.
And I say to myself "It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.'

And  I say to myself "It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.'
