You tell me you love me, you say you'll be true
Then you fly around with somebody new
But I'm crazy about you, you butterfly

You treat me mean, you're makin' me cry
I've made up my mind to tell you goodbye
But I'm no good without you, you butterfly

I knew from the first time I kissed you
That you were the troublin' kind
'Cause the honey drips from your sweet lips
One taste and I'm outta my mind

I love you so much I know what I'll do
I'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through
'Cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly

Ooh, I'm crazy about you, you butterfly

Ooh, I can't live without you, you butterfly

I knew from the first time I kissed you
That you were the troublin' kind
'cause the honey that drips from your sweet lips
One taste and I'm outta my mind

Ooh, I love you so much I know what I'll do
I'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through
'Cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly

You butterfly
You butterfly
