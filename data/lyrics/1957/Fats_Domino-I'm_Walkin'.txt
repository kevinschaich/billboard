I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'
About you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me, yeah-yeah
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin'
For your company, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you pretty baby I'll even die
I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'
About you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me

I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'
About you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me, mm-mm
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin'
For your company, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna sit right down and cry
What you gonna do when I say bye-bye
All you gonna do is dry your eye
I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'
About you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me
