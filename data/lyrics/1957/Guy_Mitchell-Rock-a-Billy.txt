Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock, rock

Some people think it came from Tennessee
Then spread on out to the lone prairie
It's the hillbilly rock, feeddlee dee
Turns me inside out
Gimme some
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock

Hey, grab yourself a partner, lose the blues
Wear your store-bought clothes and your stompin' shoes
Better head for the hills, gonna blow my fuse
Hooo, I'm gonna shout
Gimme some
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock

Since rock-a-billy swang the do-si-do
And the gee-tar man chased the old banjo
Leave the hoe for the crow, holler "Go, oh man, go"
Wiggle like a trout
Gimme some

Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, hoo!, rock, rock

From the moment I feel this crazy beat
Ya gotta lose control or you're two left feet
Give me mountain juice, turn me loose
Leave me wave my arms about
Gimme some
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock
Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock

Ya know what rock-a-billy's all about
Ya know it's gonna make ya sing and shout
Ya know you're gonna act like a crazy fool
Who cares? It's cool

Rock-a-billy, rock-a-billy, rock, rock
