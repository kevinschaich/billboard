Well now see, C. C. Rider
Well now see, see what you have done
Well now see, C. C. Rider

Well now see, see what you have done
Well you made me love you woman
Now your man has come

So I'm goin' away now baby
And I won't be back till fall
I'm goin' away now baby

And I won't be back till fall
Just might find me a good girl
Might not be comin' back at all

Well now see, C. C. Rider
See now the moon is shining bright
Well now see, C. C. Rider

See now the moon is shining bright
Just might find me that good girl
And everything would be alright
