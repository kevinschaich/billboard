Where the deep blue pearly waters
Wash upon while silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her
And obeyed our hearts command

Where the deep blue pearly waters
Wash upon while silver sands
We watched the sun set in the evening
In a far and distant land

So beneath God's blue heaven
There's a place that I must go
See the sun set in the evening
With the only girl I know

We watched the sun set in the evening
See the moon yellow and pale
Watch the gaucho's ride the pinto's
All across the pampas trail

Where the deep blue pearly waters
Wash upon while silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her
And obeyed our hearts command
