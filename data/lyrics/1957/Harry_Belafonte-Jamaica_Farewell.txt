Down the way
Where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee, rice, saltfish are nice
And the rum is fine any time o' year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down the way
Where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town.
