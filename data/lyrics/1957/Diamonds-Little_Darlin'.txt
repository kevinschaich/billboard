Ah ya ya ya ya ya 
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ah

Little Darlin' 
Oh Little Darlin'
Oh ho where are you
My Love-ah I was wrong-ah
To try to love you

Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah

Know well-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
for only you

(Spoken)

My darlin' I need you
To call my own
And never do wrong

To hold in mine 
Your little hand
I'll know too soon, 
That all is so grand
Please hold my hand

My dear-ah
I was wrong-ah
To try to love you

Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah

Know well-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
For only you
