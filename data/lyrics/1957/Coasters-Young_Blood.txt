I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin
Look a-there Look a-there
Look a-there Look a-there

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name What's your name
What's your name What's your name

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin'
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
