Oh honey babe, oh honey babe
Oh honey babe, I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good

Honey babe, I like the way that you walk by
I like the way you swing your eye
I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good

Every night I like the way you beg for more
And linger there outside the door
I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good

Well, well, well-ll-ll ain't it swell
Can't reveal-l-l how I feel
And no one else could ever thrill me like you do
You make my every dream come true
I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good

Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe
MMMMM honey babe
I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good

Honey baby I like the way you wear your clothes
My love for you just grows and grows
I like your kind of love
Honey you know I do

When you're near you don't know what you do to me
And that's the way it oughta be
I like your kind of love
Honey you know I do

Don't you know-o-o that I love you so
Can't you see-e-e that you're for me
Honey babe I like the way you hold my hand
To make me know you understand
I like your kind of love
Honey you know I do
Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe
MMMMM honey babe
I like your kind of love
That's good, baby that's good
Honey babe I like your kind of love
