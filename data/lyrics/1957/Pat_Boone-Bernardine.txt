Oh, Bernadine
Oh, oh, oh, Bernadine
I can tell by the dimple on your chin
You're in beautiful shape for the shape you're in
An' I'm in shape for Bernadine

Oh, Bernadine
Oh, oh, oh, Bernadine
When you wander into my dreams at night
Your remarkable form is a pure delight
I go, go, go for Bernadine
Bernadine, Bernadine

You're a little bit like every girl I've ever seen
Oh, your separate parts are not unknown
But the way you assemble them's all your own
All yours and mine, dear Bernadine (yours and mine, dear Bernadine)
Oh, Bernadine
Oh, oh, oh, Bernadine

Say you'll wait for me out by the rocket base
And we'll both blast off into outer space
At oh, oh, oh-oh, Bernadine
Bernadine, Bernadine

Come away with me now in the rocket-propelled machine
We'll come home by the way of a drive-in spa
Just a little this side of Shangri-La
And there I'll stay with Bernadine (there I'll stay with Bernadine)
There I'll stay with Bernadine!
