They call it a teen-age crush
They don't know how I feel
They call it a teen-age crush
They can't believe this is real

They've forgotten when they were young
And the way tried to be free
All they say is "This young generation
Is just not the way it used to be"

I know that I know my own heart
But you say I'm trying to rush
Please, don't try to keep us apart
Don't call it a teen-age crush
