Well honey I love you
Too much
I need your loving
Too much

Want the thrill of
Your touch
Gee I can't love
Too much

You do all the living
While I do all the giving
'Cause I love you
Too much

Well you spend all my money
Too much
I have to share you honey
Too much

When I want some lovin'
You're gone
Don't you know you're treating
Your daddy wrong

Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much

I need your loving
All the time
Need your hugging
Meeting mine

Need you near me
Stay real close
Please, please hear me
You're the most

Now you've got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much

Every time I kiss your
Sweet lips
I can feel my heart go
Flip-flip

I'm such a fool for
Your charms
Take me back, baby
In your arms

Like to hear you sighing
Even though I know you're lying
'Cause I love you
Too much

I need your loving
All the time
Need your hugging
Meeting mine

Need you near me
Stay real close
Please, please hear me
You're the most

Now you've got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much
