Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
You know that I love you
We could live so happily

The greatest little momma
You oughta see her reel and rock

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
You know that I love you
We could live so happily

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
You know I need you by my side
You know I need you pretty baby
Your ways I gotta really abide now

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Won't you come along with me
You know that I love you
We could live so happily
