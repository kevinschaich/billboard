Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy on a mountain top
Thirty thousand feet to drop
Spied a lady on a runaway horse
Uh huh, that's right, of course
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy met a girl named Sue
She was feeling kind of blue
Jim Dandy, he's the kind of guy
Never liked to see a little girl cry
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go

Jim Dandy had a submarine
Got a message from a mermaid queen
She was hanging from a fishing line
Jim Dandy didn't waste no time
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy wanted to go to Maine
Got a ticket on a DC plane
Jim Dandy didn't need no suit
He was hip and ready to boot
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go on, Jim Dandy
Jim Dandy's going
