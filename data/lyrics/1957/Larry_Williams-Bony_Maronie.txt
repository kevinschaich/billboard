I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaronie.
Oughta see her rock n roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone.
but I love her, and she loves me
Oh how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneath the appletree...

Well I told her mama and her papa too,
just exactly what I wanna do
I wanna get married on a night in June
And rock n roll by the light of the silvery moon
Cause I love her, and she loves me
Oh how happy now we can be
Makin love undernesth the appletree...

She's my one and only, she's my hearts desire
She's a real upseter she's a real life wire,
Everybody turns when my baby walks by
She's something to see, she really catches the eye
That's why I love her, and she loves me
Oh how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneatn the appletree.....
