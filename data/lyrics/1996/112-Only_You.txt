Check it out

(Notorious B.I.G.)
Je-sus the notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin milk em top billin
Silk and pure linen, me and little Ceas
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees,
Cats lay low like Paublo in milked out diablos
The Williest, bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
To stash more cash than Burn and Hale
Inhale make you feel good like Tony Toni Toni (feels good)
dig up in your middle like Monie (yeah)
Don't know but your settin up to blow me (Yes)
Try to style, Fly up north with a homey (Yes)
It's style is dondatta
Playas stay splurgin' game so tight they call it virgin

Oh I need to know where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love
I know I do, what about you
I just can't get enough of the time

I need you in my life
Where do we go
What do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you

Girl I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life

Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
(thought I told you that we won't stop)
You always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart

I need you in my life
Where do we go
What do I do
Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you

(Mase)
Now you can hum all you want to
Cum all you want to
Money I'm a front you
Girl I wanna flaunt you
I'm always want you
when nobody wants you
If I die now my love will still haunt you
Mase ain't the one that will pay for your phone
Mase be the one that will take you home
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone
All you days alone I could make you moan
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce
Bad boy get more money than you can count
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce
I'd do it to your cat for a large amount
And when the beef come you know where to be found
Why I be around till the winner is announced (*Puff : The winner is...*)
So there ya go girl with thousands in ya palms
Why you can't let by gones be by gones

(112)
Where do we go
What must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby
Like I am the only one for you

Girl I want to be with you (Girl i want)
No one else, only you (oh yeah, i need you ohh baby)
Why can't we just make it happen (why cant we oh)
Baby, I need you in my life (oh baby)
