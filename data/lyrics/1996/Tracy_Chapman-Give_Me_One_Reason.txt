Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby, I got your number
Oh, and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times

You can call me baby
You can call me anytime, but you got to call me

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me
Oh, and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you
Yes, and give you what you need
I said, this youthful heart can love you
Oh, and give you what you need

But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here
Yes, and I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
Oh, I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby, just give me one reason
Oh, give me just one reason why
Baby, just give me one reason
Oh, give me just one reason why I should stay

Said, I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say
