Tell me what kinda man, would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like your nothing, when your worth more than gold
Girl to me your like a Diamond, I love the way you shine
A Hundred Million dollar treasure,
I'd give the world to make you mine

I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain, we can do it all night

I'll touch all the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot
Nothing is forbidden, when we touch

CHORUS -
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)

I'll take you out on a night cruise,
on a Yacht......just cant loose
Coz we got alot to look forward to...1,2 whatcha gonna do ?
What good is a Diamond, nobody can see?
I hear he's got you on lockdown, but I got the master key

I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway I'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter, than the sound of making love
Baby when I start I just cant stop
I love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden, when we touch

CHORUS -
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)

I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway i'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter, than the sound of making love
Baby when I start I just cant stop
I love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden, when we touch

CHORUS -
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)
Sweet Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)

Ooooo, I got a Jones in my bones for you
There ain't a damn thing that I wont do
I'll make your body cream with my sex machine
I wont stop until i hear your mother scream

CHORUS -
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your wont wont do (i'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your wont wont do (i'll do them for you)
Sweet Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your wont wont do (i'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your wont wont do (i'll do them for you)
Sweet Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your man wont do (i'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of, the things your wont wont do (i'll do them for you)
