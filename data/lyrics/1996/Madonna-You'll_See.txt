You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see
Somehow, some way

You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see
You think that you destroyed my faith in love
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see
Somehow, some day

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive

All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

You think that you are strong but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see
Somehow, some day

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive

I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
