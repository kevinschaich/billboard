All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry...
One day all 7 will die

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all 
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hands she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance, an army's marching feet (Hup 2 3 4 - Hup 2 3 4)
But behold... we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright (that's alright)
For I will watch them fall (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all 
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

(Just how old?)

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear 
For in the distance, 12 souls from now 
You and me will still be here...
We will still be here

There will be a new city with the streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old, and
There will be no death, for with every breath 
A voice of many colors sings a song that's so... bold
Sing it while we watch them fall (fall...)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect, and a savoir-faire
No one else in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and, you are mine and to-
-gether we'll love through all 
Space and time, so don't cry...
One day all 7 will die

(Just how old)
