It's called the rump shaker, the piece is like sweeter than candy
I'm feelin' manly and you say it's comin' in handy
Slidin' my claws from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin' you around Delaware before I enter
Total seduction, from face, hips, to feet
A wiggle and jiggle can make the night complete
Now since you got the body of the year, come and get the award
Here's a hint, it's like a long sharp sword
Flip tail, so let me see you shake it up like dice
The way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice
But A+ got a surprise that's a back breaker
Now let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump
All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump
All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom

It's Teddy, ready with the 1-2 checker
Wreckx-N-Effect is in effect, but I'm the wrecker
Off the track, â€˜bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'
The action is packed than a jam like the kinds of beat
Bound to get you up, cold flowin' like a faucet
Not meant to make you sit, not meant to make you jump
But Jet make the hotties in the parties shake your rump
I like the way you comb your hair, uh
I like the stylish clothes you wear, uh
It's just the little things you do, uh
That makes me wanna get with you, uh

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump
All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump
All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
Just shake your rump

Shake it, shake it, shake it, now shake it
She could spend every birthday butt naked
Body and soul, makin' me wanna squish her
More just in the game a rumper like a sub-woofer
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night
Come on pass the poom-poom, send it to papa
Shake it, baby, shake it, baby, shake it, don't stoppa
Let me see you do the booty hock, and now I'll make the booty stock
Now drop and do the booty rock
The way you're shakin' your grill's really kill
It's makin' broth' ills up a whole lot of pills
But I ain't into trickin' just to treatin'
And I ain't into treatin' every trick that I'm meetin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, shake it, baby, shake it down, shake it like that

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom
