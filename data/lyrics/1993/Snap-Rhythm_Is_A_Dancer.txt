Let the rhythm ride you, guide you
Sneak inside you set your mind to move
To its pulsation, bass vibrations
Sense sensation, pause is not implicit
Mind and body must be free too
Please take it all way, nothing to lose
Everything to win

Let it control you hold you mold you
Not the old, the new, touch it, taste it
Free your soul let it invade you
Gotto to be what you wanna
If the groove don't get you the rhyme flow's gonna
I'm serious as cancer when I say
"Rhythm is a dancer"
