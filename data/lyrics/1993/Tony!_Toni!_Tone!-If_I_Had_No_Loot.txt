Da-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay, Da-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay
Da-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay

If the shoe fits I want you to wear it,
And wear it good,
Ah-ah, ah-ah-yeah, ah-ah-hah

Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself,
I would always be lookin' for somebody else
But as time went on I had a talk with my mind,
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Friends and enemies around me everyday,
I can't believe half the things they say
Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all,
I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me,
Can't trust no one as far as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall, listenin' to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
But you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you,
Sons Of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me,
My phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends
And that so what they say
Constantly takin' from me everyday, you say

You call me your friend
But you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you,
Sons Of Soul, y'all
