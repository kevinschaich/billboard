SPOKEN INTRO
Yeah, we doin' this one for all da ladies
Ha, H-town boys
Kickin' it with my boy Luke
For da '93 you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we will be knockin' da boots

They gon' do something a lil' sexy like you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, check da verse

VERSE 1
A late night, I thought to back to when we made good love
Listening to some Marvin Gaye all night long
But I want that whole thing back
Make these moments once again go right
So won't ya, so won't ya, do it for us babe

BRIDGE
Good loving body rockin' knockin' boots all night long, yeah
Making love until we're tired, till the break of dawn, oh come on
Oh come on and turn the lights down and let me get on it, yeah
'Cause when I do just me and you, it'll be so right

CHORUS
Now give me some good love
(Some body rockin', knockin' da boots)
Now give me some good love
(Some body rockin', knockin' da boots)
Some body rockin' baby
Now give me some good love
(Some body rockin', knockin' da boots)
That's all I need, I need
Now give me some good love
(Some body rockin', knockin' da boots)

VERSE 2

All night long baby, all night long long long

BRIDGE
Good loving body rockin' knockin' boots all night long, oh oh
Making love until we're tired, till the break of dawn, ohh come on
