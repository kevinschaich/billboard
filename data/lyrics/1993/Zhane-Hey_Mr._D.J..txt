I am ready to call my friends
So we can boogie down
Where's the party hey Mr DJ

Hey Mr. DJ you can get this started,
Everybody's ready to party all night, all night
All the girls are ready
So we can all get to it,
So we can party 'til the break of dawn

Once again, it's on, yo Zhané blow the horn
Let the D.J. know to keep playing your song
Maybe I'll browse, snatch up a blouse
Rip the foul, ho
And get rub-a-dub style
'Cause your body won't move
If it can't feel the groove
So can't boogie, have to show and prove
Hey, now I'm feeling the vibe
Rolling wit the flava
Feeling alright
Ho, yo, there's a party over here
Yo, oh no, the party's over there
Call up your friends, let 'em know
Fam's tagging along
Hey D.J. keep playing that song

Everybody move your body now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move & groove
Hey DJ keep playin that song all night on and on and on
(DJ play that record)
(On and on and on and on)

Everybody move your body now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move & groove
Hey DJ keep playin that song all night on and on and on
(DJ play that record)
(On and on and on and on)


Everybody move your body now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move & groove
Hey DJ keep playin that song all night on and on and on
(On and on and on and on)

Do it
