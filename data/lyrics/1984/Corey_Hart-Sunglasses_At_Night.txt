I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Watch you weave then breathe your story lines
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Keep track of the visions in my eyes

While she's deceiving me
It cuts my security 
Has she got control of me?
I turn to her and say

Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no

I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Forget my name while you collect your claim
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
See the light that's right before my eyes

While she's deceiving me
She cuts my security 
Has she got control of me?
I turn to her and say

Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
Don't be afraid of the guy in shades
Oh no, it can't escape you
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no

Oh
I said
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night

I'll say it to you now
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night

I cry to you
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
