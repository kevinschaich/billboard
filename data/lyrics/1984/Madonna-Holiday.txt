Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation

It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together
To release the pressure
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate

Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together
And make things better
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday (holiday)
Took some time to celebrate (celebrate)
Just one day out of life (just one day)
It would be, it would be so nice

Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

If we took a holiday (come on, oh yeah)
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life (holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

Holiday, celebration
Come together in every nation
