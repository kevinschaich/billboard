Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an' made my life so sweet
Step out like a God-found child
I saw your eyes across the street

Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find

Watch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink it neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine

Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time
Who am I to say that's crazy
Love will make you blind
