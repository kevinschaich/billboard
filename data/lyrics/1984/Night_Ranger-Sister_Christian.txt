Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one to say okay
Where you going, what you looking for?
You know those boys don't wanna play no more with you
It's true

You're motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding Mister Right?
You'll be all right tonight

Babe, you know you're growing up so fast
And Mama's worrying that you won't last to say, let's play
Sister Christian, there's so much in life
Don't you give it up before your time is due
It's true
It's true, yeah

Motoring
What's your price for flight?
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night

Motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding Mister Right?
You'll be all right tonight

Motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding Mister Right?
You'll be all right tonight

You're motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding Mister Right?
You'll be all right tonight

Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one to say okay
But you're motoring
You're motoring
