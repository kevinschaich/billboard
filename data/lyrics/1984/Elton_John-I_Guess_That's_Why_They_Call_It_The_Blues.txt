Don't wish it away 
Don't look at it like it's forever 
Between you and me 
I could honestly say 
That things can only get better 

And while I'm away 
Dust out the demons inside 
And it won't be long 
Before you and me run 
To the place in our hearts 
Where we hide 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

Just stare into space 
Picture my face in your hands 
Live for each second 
Without hesitation 
And never forget I'm your man 

Wait on me girl 
Cry in the night if it helps 
But more than ever
I simply love you 
More than I love life itself 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

Wait on me girl 
Cry in the night if it helps 
But more than ever
I simply love you 
More than I love life itself 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

(Laughing like children, living like lovers) 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
(Laughing like children, living like lovers) 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
