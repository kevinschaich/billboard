Joanna, I love you 
You're the one
The one for me

I'm in love
And I wouldn't lie
She's my girl 
And always on my mind

She gives me her love
And a feeling that's right
Never lets me down
Especially at night

So I'm gonna do
The best that I can
To please that girl
And be her only man

You see, she picks me up
When I'm feeling low
And that's why, baby
I've got to let you know

Joanna, I love you 
You're the one
The one for me
Huh, baby

She's the one
The one for me
She's the kind of girl
Make you feel nice, so

I'll try my best
To do what's right
I take her for a ride
Everything's fine

Joanna, I love you 
You're the one
The one for me

Searched so far
Searched so long
To find someone
Someone to count on

Now I feel 
I've got it right here
Found it in you, baby
You, my dear

We can build
A life so nice
We'll have it all and
Everything will be all right

I'm promising you
Take it from me
Take it home, baby
take it home, baby

She's the one
The one for me
She's the kind of girl
Make you feel nice, so

I'll try my best
To do what's right
I take her for a ride
Everything's fine

Ooh, Joanna
Ooh, Joanna

Joanna, I love you 
You're the one
The one for me
Mmm, yeah

Joanna, I love you
(Yes, I love you)
You're the one
The one for me

Believe me, baby
Believe what I say
