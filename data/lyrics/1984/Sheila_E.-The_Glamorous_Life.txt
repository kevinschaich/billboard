She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summer time 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 

She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl, 
She really wants is to be in love with a man 
 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to 55 Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous 

Lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much
