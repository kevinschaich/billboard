I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way

I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just livin' in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sittin' 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sittin' 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Hey, baby!
