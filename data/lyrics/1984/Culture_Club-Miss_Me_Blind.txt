Miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Bet you got a good gun
Bet you know how
To have some fun and then
You turn it around on me because
I'm better than the rest of the men

I say you'll miss me
And you always do
I say you'll miss me
Now would I lie to you

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Bet you make the fool run
Bet you know how
To make it last forever
But you know I'm never really sure
If you're just kissing to be clever

I say you'll miss me
And you always do
I say you'll miss me
Now would I lie to you

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

Because this love
That I have to give
Must be better than that kind
It can make you rich
It can make you poor
But i know that you'll miss me blind

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind
