We started dancing and love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move.
The music played while our bodies displayed through the dance,
Then love picked us out for romance.

I thought it was clear
The plan was we would share,
This feeling just between ourselves.

But when the music changed
The plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?

Love said:

Let the music play
He won't get away,
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play.
Let the music play
He won't get away,
This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.

He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me.
Guess he's discovered we are truly lovers,
Magic from the very start, 'cause love just kept me groovin',

And he felt me movin' even though we danced apart.
So we started dancing and love put us into the groove
As soon as we started to move, as soon as we started to move.

Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play.
Let the music play
He won't get away,
This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.

He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me
He's dancing his way back to me

Let the music play

This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.
