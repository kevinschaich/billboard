I have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing and loving it all

But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and
Delighting with tears
As we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find

So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be 
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start) whoa

You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do
And that this is just one 
Of those games that we play

So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry any more
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know 
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
(Hold me in your loving arms)
Warm my heart
(Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me
(Ooohooohooo stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start

Hold me now, whoa
(Hold me in your loving arms)
Warm my heart
(Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me
(Ooohooohooo stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start

(Repeat chorus 4 times till fade out)
