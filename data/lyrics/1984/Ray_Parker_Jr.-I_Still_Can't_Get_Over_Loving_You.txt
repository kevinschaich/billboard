I'm all confused and I don't know what to do
‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you
I've had a time when I can't you off my mind
No, I still can't get over lovin' you

Every time I run into your friends
I just have to ask them with who and where you've been
And when they tell me what I really didn't want to know
It only breaks my heart, it makes me want you more

When I hear your name, I get going insane
‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you
I can't turn you loose, though I know it's self-abuse
I still can't get over lovin' you

Now I've tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use, ‘cause I expect them to be like you, baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do
‘Cause every girl I date resembles you

Oh, help me, baby, I'm goin' crazy
I still can't get over lovin' you
No, oh, it's tearin' my heart apart
‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you

Girl, I'm so sad and it hurts me so bad
Knowin' you're with someone else (Someone else), oh
Though I have no right to be, I'm filled with jealousy
‘Cause I want you for myself

And I'm not blamin' you, naw, baby
It's not your fault if you feel the way I do
And even though I wish that you'd still love me
It still won't change the way I feel for you

Girl, I can't forget ‘cause it's not over yet
I still can't get over lovin' you
Every breath you take, I'll be watchin' you, girl
‘Cause I still can't get over lovin' you, mmm

(Lovin' you) There's no way that this thing is through, no
(I still can't get over) Not yet, I ain't through lovin' you
I'm gettin' mad (Lovin' you), girl, don't you ever try to leave, no, no
(I still can't get over) It'll be the last thing you'll ever do, oh

(Lovin' you)
(I still can't get over lovin' you) 
(Lovin' you)...
