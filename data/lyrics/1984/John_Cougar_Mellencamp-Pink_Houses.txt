There's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin', I can remember when
You could stop a clock"

Ah, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America? Somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America? Home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me
Ooh yeah, for you and me

Well, there's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station
He's got greasy hair, greasy smile
He says, "Lord this must be my destination"
'Cause they told me when I was younger
Said, "Boy, you're gonna be president"
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went

Ah, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America? Somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America? Home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me
Ah, yeah, baby, for you and me

Well, there's people and more people
What do they know know know?
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico, ooh yeah
And there's winners and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
'Cause the simple man, baby, pays for the thrills, the bills
The pills that kill

Ah, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America? Somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America? Home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me, ooh
Ooh yeah

Ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America? Hey, somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America? Oh, the home of the free
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little pink houses, babe, for you and me
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
