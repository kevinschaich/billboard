Heavenly Father watching us fall
We take from each other and give nothing at all
Well it's a dog-gone shame
But never too late for change
So if your luck runs low
Just reach out and call His name, His name

Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Whenever you call

Never be lonely lost in the night
Just run from the darkness
Looking for the light
'Cause it's a long hard road
That leads to a brighter day, hey
Don't let your heart grow cold
Just reach out and call His name, His name

Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Yah mo be there (up and over)
Whenever you call

(Yah mo be there)
You can count on it, brother
'Cause we're all just finding our way
Traveling through time
People got to keep pushing on
No matter how many dreams slip away
Yah will be there

Well it's a dog-gone shame
But never too late for change
So when your luck runs low
Just reach out and call His name
Just call His name
