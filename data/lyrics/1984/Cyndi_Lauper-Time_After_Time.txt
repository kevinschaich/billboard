Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories

Time after sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow."
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "Go slow."
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
