Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time, little darling, I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
