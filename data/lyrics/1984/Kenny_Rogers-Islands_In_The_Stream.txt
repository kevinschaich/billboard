Baby when I met you, there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine toothed comb
I was soft inside
There was somethin' going on

You do somethin' to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love, we feel, needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Sail away
Ohhh, come sail away with me

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
