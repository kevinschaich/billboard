Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

So you think I got an evil mind
I'll tell you honey
I don't know why
I don't know why

So you think my singing's out of time
It makes me money
I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
Oh, no

So, come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Get wild

So you say I got a funny face
I got no worries
And I don't know why
I don't know why

Lord, I gotta sing, it's some disgrace
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
No, no, no

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Get wild, come on!

Well, you think we are the lazy type
You should know better
I don't know why
I don't know why

So you say I got a dirty mind
I'm a mean go-getter
I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
Oh, no

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Oh, wild

Come on! (Come on!)
Feel it!
Come on!
(Rock your boys)
Work it!
We'll get wild, wild, wild,
(We're gonna get wild)
Wild, wild, wild
(We're gonna get wild tonight)
Come on, feel the noise
(Rock it tonight)
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
(Oh, yeah)

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah (Whoo!)
Ah, ah, ah

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah
