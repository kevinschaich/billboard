Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today 
To get through this thing called life
Electric word "life"
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else
The afterworld

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun
Day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life 
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

Woo!

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Aah, aah!" is all I heard

I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go!

Uh-huh!

All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go!

Come on, baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Go crazy
Woo! Huh!
I said, let's go (go) crazy (crazy)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's go (let's go)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!
