Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny

I said it again
But could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait 'til you decide

Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
And every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind

Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

(I light my torch and wave it for the)

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
