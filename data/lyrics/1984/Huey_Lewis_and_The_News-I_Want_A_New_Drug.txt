Yeah-eah! 

I want a new drug
One that won't make me sick 
One that won't make me crash my car 
Or make me feel three feet thick

I want a new drug
One that won't hurt my head 
One that won't make my mouth too dry 
Or make my eyes too red

One that won't make me nervous 
Wondering what to do 
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you 
When I'm alone with you

I want a new drug 
One that won't spill 
One that don't cost too much 
Or come in a pill

I want a new drug 
One that won't go away 
One that won't keep me up all night 
One that won't make me sleep all day

One that won't make me nervous 
Wondering what to do 
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you 
When I'm alone with you 
I'm alone with you, baby

I want a new drug 
One that does what it should 
One that won't make me feel too bad 
One that won't make me feel too good

I want a new drug 
One with no doubt 
One that won't make me talk too much 
Or make my face break out

One that won't make me nervous 
Wondering what to do 
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you 
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you
