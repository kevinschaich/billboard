Afternoon in the homeroom
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam
On the plan you had tonight

You've been messing around
With a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know
Could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you

And the long halls
And the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school

And that's why the student body
Got a bad reputation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You're back to school, it's a bad situation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
But what you want
Is an adult education

Oh yeah

The teacher don't know about how
To deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are
Flashing hot and cool
All your girlfriends care about
What you wear and
Talking about it
Believe it or not
There's life after high school

That's why the student body
Got a bad reputation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, it's a bad situation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
But what you want
Is an adult education

Oh yeah

They're calling it a preparation
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

The senior with the junior miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education
Adult education, adult education
It's a bad situation, adult education

Adult, adult, adult, adult education
Adult education, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Adult, adult, adult, adult
Adult, adult, adult, adult

The high point of low school
Is getting out of there
The low point of high school
Is what you wear
