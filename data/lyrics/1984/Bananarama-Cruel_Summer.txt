Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying (What did they say?) things I can't understand 
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand 

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you've gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go 

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you've gone, you're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer 
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer 
Now you've gone

It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Now you've gone, you're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer 
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer 
Now you've gone, you're not the only one
