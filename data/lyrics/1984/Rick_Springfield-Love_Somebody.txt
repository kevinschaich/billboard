I can see the path you're cutting
It cost me a little piece of my heart 
I can see the doors you're shutting
'Cause they were open at the start

Baby, loving you has been hard on me 
You're such a tough little sister
Just looking for Mr. Right 
On the wrong side of town 

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night 

Your eyes are wild, your skin's so white
You're undernourished and overfed 
She's got the teeth, she knows how to bite
'Cause when you bit I bled 

You got the perfect image
Of the perfect man 
You're a tough little sister
But you'll settle for a mister tonight 
But you're running out of time 

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night

I'm only saying what I feel
You think I'm wrong I know 
You thought I was sleeping at the wheel
I thought that you were driving 

You better love somebody
You better love somebody

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night 

One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh oh
