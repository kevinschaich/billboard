Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China 
In a little row boat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no-one to hold you 
What does that mean
And you said 

Ain't nothin' gonna to break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no
I got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts 
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast
And she said 

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no 
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh-no, I got to keep on moving

Never let another girl like you, work me over
Never let another girl like you, drag me under
If I meet another girl like you, I will tell her
Never want another girl like you, have to say
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
