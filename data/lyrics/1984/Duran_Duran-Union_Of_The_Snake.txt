Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing my senses together
And I think it's about to break

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength at least give me a light
Give me anything even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on  the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
It's gonna race, it's gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
It's gonna race, it's gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderline
