Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playing 'round, boy that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

Do what you do to me
You've got me burning up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!
I think you get to me
I've got to give it up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

Do what you do to me
You've got me burning up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!
I think you get to me
I've got to give it up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!
