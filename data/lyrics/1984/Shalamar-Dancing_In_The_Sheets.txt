I caught you smiling
I know I've seen you here before
How come you're hiding
Hey don't cha wanna hit the floor?

The place is crowded
Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead
(Dancing in the sheets)

Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me we should be dancing in the sheets
(Dancing in the sheets)

We feel the rhythm
We've got the music on our side
If we go with 'em
I'll bet we'll have a wonderful ride

Your hands are cold
So maybe we could make some heat
Love is always born on a chance
So wrap around me and baby let's dance
(Dancing in the sheets)

Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me we should be dancing in the sheets
(Dancing in the sheets)

Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me we should be dancing in the sheets
(Dancing in the sheets)
(Dancing in the sheets)
(Dancing in the sheets)
(Dancing in the sheets)
