Do we deserve a second chance? 
How did we fall into this circumstance? 
We weren't so straight and narrow 
This is much more than we deserve 

A higher voice has called the tune 
Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume 
The gift of life extension 
By divine intervention 

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around 

Don't understand what's going on 
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone 
This is a new beginning 
I'm back in the land of the living 

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
And I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
Oh, I'm gonna get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
You know I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait
You know I gotta get it right
I'm gonna make it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we've found
The second time around
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that Heaven can wait
