Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abused ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf

Another day, some other way
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again
I've had enough, we've had enough
Cold in vain, she said

I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winning
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart

Round and round
With love we'll find a way, just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, dig

Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
The way you move, you know it's easy to see
The neon light's on me tonight
I've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight

Like Romeo to Juliet
Time and time, I'm gonna make you mine
I've had enough, we've had enough
It's all the same, she said

I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winning
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart

Round and round
With love we'll find a way, just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, yeah

Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abused ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf

Round and round
With love we'll find a way, just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why

Round and round
With love we'll find a way, just give it time, time, time, time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, why, why, why
Round and round
