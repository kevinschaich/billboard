No more timing
Each tear that falls from my eyes
I'm not hiding
The remedy to cure this old heart of mine

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from
Down here below where the street sees me lonely for you, oh

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

I can dream about you
I'm gonna press my lips against you
And hold you to me
I can dream about you
You know you got me spellbound
What else can it be?

Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from
The pain in my heart cause it's you that I need

I can dream
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, (whoa-oh-oh-oh), I can dream
Yes, I can dream
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you
(Not even for a minute)
Ooh, now baby, I'm caught up
In the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight (ooh)
I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream, I can dream
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream about you, whoa-oh-whoa
I can dream about you, oh-oh
You know how to hold me just right
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I can dream about you, I can dream
