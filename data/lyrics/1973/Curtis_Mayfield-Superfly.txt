Darkest of night
With the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong
Lotta things goin' on

The man of the hour
Has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long

Oh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind, wasn't dumb

But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Wooh, Superfly

The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean? He wouldn't know

"Can't be like the rest"
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

Superfly
Superfly
Superfly
Superfly

Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
