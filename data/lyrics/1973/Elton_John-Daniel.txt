Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

Oh, Daniel my brother
You are older than me
Do you still feel the pain 
Of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died 
But you see more than I
Daniel you're a star
In the face of the sky

They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
Well, Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

Oh, Daniel my brother
You are older than me
Do you still feel the pain 
Of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died 
But you see more than I
Daniel you're a star
In the face of the sky

Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

Oh, Daniel my brother
You are older than me
Do you still feel the pain 
Of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died 
But you see more than I
Daniel you're a star
In the face of the sky

Daniel my brother
You are older than me
Do you still feel the pain 
Of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died 
But you see more than I
Daniel you're a star
In the face of the sky

Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh, God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh, God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
