People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

Powers keep on lyin'
While your people keep on dyin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
'Til I reach the highest ground

Teachers keep on teachin'
Preachers keep on preachin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

Lovers keep on lovin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
'Til I reach my highest ground

'Til I reach my highest ground
Oh no
No one's gonna bring me down
Oh no
'Til I reach my highest ground
Don't you let nobody bring you down
God is gonna show you higher ground
He's the only friend you have around
