Me and Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet everyday at the same café
6:30 and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox play our favorite song

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We've gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations
And so and so do I

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
Tomorrow we'll meet the same place, the same time

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on
We've gotta be extra careful
We can't afford to build our hopes up too high

I wanna meet and talk with you
At the same place, the same café, the same time
And we're gonna hold hands like we used to
We're gonna talk it over, talk it over
We know, they know and you know and I know that it was wrong
But I'll make it strong
We've gotta let 'em know now
We've got a thing going on, thing going on
