I wanna jump, but I'm afraid I'll fall 
I wanna holler, but the joint's too small 
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too 
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu 

Want some lovin' babe and that ain't all
I wanna kiss her, but she's way too tall 
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too 
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu 

Wanna squeeze her, but I'm way too low 
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow 
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too 
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu 

I wanna squeeze her, but I'm way too low 
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow 
Young man rhythm got a hold of me, too 
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu 

Baby comin', now, I'm hurryin' home 
I know she's leavin', 'cause I'm takin' too long 
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too 
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
