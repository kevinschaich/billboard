Why do I keep my mind on you all the time?
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)
Why do I feel this way thinking about you every day?
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)

Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high (I wanna take to the sky)
Loving you more till the day I die (oh, natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high (I want you to be mine)
Loving you more...

If you have anything to do, call me and I will do it for you
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)
(Hey, genie)
If I only had one wish to give,
That wish would be for you to live forever and ever (I don't know you)

When I see you on the street
My heart skips a beat

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high (I'll just take to the sky)
Loving you more till the day I die (oh, natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high (loving you more)
Loving you more...

I'm gonna try to do all the things you want me to
If you just give me a chance (I don't know you)
I'm trying to make something out of nothing
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)

Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more...

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving, loving you

Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving, loving you...
