He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way 
He had a boogie style that no one else could play 
He was the top man at his craft 
But then his number came up, and he was gone with the draft 
He's in the Army now, a-blowin' Reveille
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam 
It really brought him down because he could not jam 
The Captain seemed to understand 
Because the next day the Cap' went out and drafted a band 
And now the Company jumps when he plays Reveille 
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

A-root, a-toot, a-toot-diddely-ada-toot 
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm 
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'im 
A-ha-ha-hand the company jumps when he plays Reveille 
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

He was some boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 
And when he plays boogie-woogie bugle he was busy as a "bzzzy" bee 
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar 
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

A toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada, toot-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar 
Can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'im 
A-ha-ha-hand the Company jumps when he plays Reveille 
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

(bugle solo)

He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night 
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright 
They clap their hands, and stamp their feet 
'Cause they know how he blows when someone gives him a beat 
Whoa-whoa he breaks it up when he plays Reveille 
The boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B 

A-root, a toot, a-toot-diddely-ada-doot to-to-toot
He blows, eight to the bar
He can blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't, whoa, with him
And the company jumps when he plays Reveille 
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B!
