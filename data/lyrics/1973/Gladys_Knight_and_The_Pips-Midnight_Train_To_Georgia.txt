L.A. proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man, he couldn't make it)
So he's leaving a life
He's come to know, ooh

(He said he's going)
He said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago

He's leaving (leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia, yeah
(Leaving on the midnight train) yeah
Said he's going back (going back to find)
To a simpler place and time, oh yes he is
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)

I'll be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world (live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreaming (dreaming)
Ooh, that some day he'd be a star
(A superstar, but he didn't get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true, oh no, uh uh
(Dreams don't always come true, uh uh, no, uh uh)

So he pawned all his hopes
(Woo, woo, woo-woo)
And even sold his old car
(Woo, woo, woo-woo)
Bought a one way ticket back to the life he once knew
Oh yes he did, he said he would

Oh-oh, he's leaving (leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia, yeah
(Leaving on a midnight train)
Said he's going back to find, ooh
(Going back to find)
A simpler place and time, ooh, yeah
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)

Yeah, I'm gonna be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world (live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

Ooh, he's leaving (leaving)
On the midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train), yeah, ooh y'all
Said he's going back to find (Going back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time, ooh y'all, uh-huh
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)

I've got to be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world (live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

For love, gonna board the midnight train to ride
For love, gonna board, gotta board the midnight train to go
For love, gonna board, uh huh, the midnight train to go

My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
