Remember the day you up and left
I nearly cried myself to death, oh yeah
And then I met someone else
She made me stop and get a hold of myself

Oh girl, I'm doin' fine now
Without you, baby
I'm doin' fine now
Without you baby

Remember the day you walked away
I ran behind you and I begged you to stay, oh yeah
But you never heard a word I said
You kept on steppin', never turning your head, yeah

Oh girl, I'm doin' fine now
Without you, baby
I'm doin' fine now
Without you, baby

Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do

I'm doin' fine now
Without you, baby
I'm doin' fine now
Without you, baby
(I'm doin' fine now)
Hey, you had a chance now
Baby, baby
(I'm doin' fine now)
(Without you baby)
Say, you had your chance
Baby, baby
(I'm doin' fine now)
(Without you baby)
You didn't want me around
(I'm doin' fine now)
(Without you baby)
You had your chance
(I'm doin' fine now)
(Without you baby)
