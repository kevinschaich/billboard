Funny Face, I love you
Funny Face, I need you
My whole worlds wrapped up in you

When the road I walk seems all up hill
And the colors in my rainbow turn blue
You kiss the tears away
You smile at me and say
Funny Face, Funny face I love you

Funny Face, I love you
Funny Face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny Face, don't leave me
Funny Face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you.

And when I hurt your feelings as I sometimes do
And I say those mean things that we know are not true
You forgive my childish ways
You hold me close and say
Funny Face, Funny Face I love you

Funny Face, I love you
Funny Face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny Face, don't leave me
Funny Face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you

Funny Face, I love you
Funny Face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny Face, don't leave me
Funny Face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
