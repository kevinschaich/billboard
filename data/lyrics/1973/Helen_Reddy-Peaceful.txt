In the morning fun when no one will be drinking any more wine
I'll wake the sun up by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup
And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow

Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here

In the evening shadows are callin' me and the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday when my plans were giggled in rhyme

And maybe some day he'll up and say "We had a pretty nice time", oh, oh, oh, my

'cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here
