He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wolloe said hello
And he said, "Hi, what's doin', Wo?" 
Said, "Sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt."

He said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth."
Well, he got mad and he saw red
And Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walkin' on home, 'cause he didn't live far
See, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife musta left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Papa had left him and that was a gun

Then he went off to Andy's house
Slippin' through the back woods, quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lyin' on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Well, the Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
And a big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said "Why'd you do it?"
Well, the judge said guilty in a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile 
Said, "Supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house in back that night were mine
And his cheatin' wife had never left town
But that's one body that'll never be found
See, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia, whoa-oh
That's the night that they hung an innocent man, uh-huh
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands

Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
