They call me a gypsy man
They call me a gypsy man

They call me a gypsy man
They call me a gypsy man

They call me a gypsy man
'Cause I don't stay in one place too long

I'm searchin' for a brand new world
To make and call my home

To make my home ohh, yeah

'Cause I'm a gypsy man
Yes, I'm a gypsy man
Oh, I'm a gypsy man
