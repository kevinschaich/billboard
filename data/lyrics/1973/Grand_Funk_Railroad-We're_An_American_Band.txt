Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie, doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact

Up all night with Freddie King
I got to tell you, poker's his thing
Booze and ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective, he was outta sight

Now these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on, dudes. Let's get it on"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band, wooh
We're an American band, wooh
We're an American band, wooh
