When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changin' world
In which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die

(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changin' world
In which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die

(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)
