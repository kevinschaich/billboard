I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holdin' hands and skippin' stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doin' a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rockin' 'round the clock
We were hoppin' and boppin' to the Crocodile Rock, well

Crocodile rockin' is somethin' shockin', when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights, when Suzie wore her dresses tight and uh
Crocodile rockin' was-a out of-a sight

(La, la la la la la)
(La la la la la)
(La la la la la)

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights cryin' by the record machine
Dreamin' of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we got
Burnin' up to the crocodile rock
Learnin' fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the crocodile rock would last, well

Crocodile rockin' is somethin' shockin', when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights, when Suzie wore her dresses tight and uh
Crocodile rockin' was-a out of-a sight

(La, la la la la la)
(La la la la la)
(La la la la la)
