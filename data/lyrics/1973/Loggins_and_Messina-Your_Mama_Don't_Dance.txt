Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll

The old folks say that you
Gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late, it's a sin

There just ain't no excuse
And you know you're gonna lose
You never win, I'll say it again

And it's all because
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll

You pull into a drive-in
You find a place to park
You hop into the backseat
Where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move
You're thinking it's a breeze

There's a light in your eye
And then a guy says
Out of the car, long hair
Oowee, you're coming with me
The local police

And it's all because
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll

Where do you go to rock and roll
Where do you go to rock and roll
