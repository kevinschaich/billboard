My father married a pure Cherokee
My mother's people were ashamed of me
The Indians said that I was white by law
The white man always called me "Indian Squaw"

Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, "She's no good," they warned.
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

We never settled, went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
"Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee"

Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, "She's no good," they warned.
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed
Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame
My life since then has been from man to man
But I can't run away from what I am

Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, "She's no good," they warned.
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, "She's no good," they warned.
Both sides were against me since the day I was born
