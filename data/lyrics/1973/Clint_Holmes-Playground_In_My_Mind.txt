When this old world is getting me down
And there's no love to be found
I close my eyes and soon I find
I'm in a playground in my mind
Where the children laugh
And the children play
And we sing a song all day

My name is Michael
I've got a nickel
I've got a nickel shiny and new
I'm gonna buy me all kinds of candy
That's what I'm gonna do

In the wonders that I find
In the playground in my mind
In a world that used to be
Close your eyes and follow me

Where the children laugh
And the children play
And we'll sing a song all day

My girl is Cindy
When we get married
We're gonna have a baby or two
We're gonna let them visit their grandma
That's what were gonna do

See the little children
Living in a world
That I left behind
Happy little children
In the playground in my mind

See the little children
See how they play so happy
In the playground in my mind

La la la la la la la la la...
