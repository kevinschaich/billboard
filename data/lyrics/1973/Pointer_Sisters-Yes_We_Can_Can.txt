Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another.
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers.
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another.
And do respect the women of the world.
Remember you all have mothers.
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out.

And we gotta take care of all the children,
The little children of the world.
'cause they're our strongest hope for the future,
The little bitty boys and girls.

We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes we can can.
