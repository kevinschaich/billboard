My Maria
Don't you know I have come a long, long way
I've been longing to see her, when she's around, she takes my blues away

Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria) 
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you

My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind

Gypsy lady
You're a miracle worker for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right, lady, take me away

Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria) 
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you

Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria) 
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you
