Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
When it's time for leavin'
I hope you'll understand
I was born a ramblin' man

My father was a gambler down in Georgia
Well he wound up on the wrong end of a gun
And I was born in the back seat of a, a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down the highway 41

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
When it's time for leavin'
I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

(All right!)

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They always having a good time down on the bayou, Lord
And them Delta women think the world of me

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin'
I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
