It's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappoint you
I didn't mean to tell you lies

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why?

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try? 

It's been a long time since I've kissed you
It always used to feel so good
And if you knew how much I missed you
You'd forgive me if you could

And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try? (one more try)

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try?

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why?
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try? (one more try)

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try?

Oh girl, you know I love you
I just want you to know
Our love, I'll always treasure
So please, just don't let me go
