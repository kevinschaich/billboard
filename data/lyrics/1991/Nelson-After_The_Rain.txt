Look in the mirror, girl
By now you should know
You're living in a fantasy
And you can't let go

He never really loved you
From the start
The only thing he ever gave you
Was a broken heart

Don't be afraid to lose
What was never meant to be

Whoa, after the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

I'm waiting as my heart
Beats just for you
Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through

But things will never change
Until you want them to

Whoa, after the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

Whoa, whoa, after the rain
(After the rain)
You'll see the sun appear
To light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find
True love again

He never really loved you
From the start
The only thing he ever gave you
Was a broken heart

Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through
You know the time has come for you
To face the truth

After the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

Whoa, whoa, after the rain
(After the rain)
You'll see the sun appear
To light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find
True love again

(After the rain)
Whoa, whoa, after the rain
Can you love again

After the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you love again
