Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever

I adore (I adore) mi amor (yeah)
I adore mi amor

You want to take her place
You say you'd treat me better
Better I know for sure
You see she loves me
And I could never leave her
Never baby, never

She means the world to me
And I love her, she's my destiny
I know, forever my love
And I'll never let her go, no no

Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever

I adore mi amor
I adore mi amor
Listen

My love, the girl of my dreams
And I will never leave
She's all that I need and more
I'll love her always
What more could a man ask for?
(What more could I ask for?)

You know that I really love my baby
She can give me everything I need
There is no one to take her place
She's got my heart in her hands
Baby, I adore

Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever

I adore (I adore) mi amor
I adore mi amor

Ooh mi amor es por ti que yo vivo y por ti suspiro
No solo hoy, solo hoy si no siempre
Tu estrella brilla siempre en mi
Y este sueño contigo sera realidad te quiero mucho
Baby te quiero mucho, mi amor
