Two, three, four!

Rainy night and we worked all day
Both got jobs 'cause there's bills ta pay
We got somethin' they can't take away
Our love, our lives

Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh ta flesh, one to one (and it's all right)
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's OK
Our time, our way

So hold me close, better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
Two kids hitchin' down the road'a life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's all right)
And I'll know that you'll live in my heart 'til the day that I die

'Cause you were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

And my heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh ta flesh, one to one (and it's all right)
And I'll never let go 
'Cause somethin' I know deep insiiide

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made
Ta be your man
