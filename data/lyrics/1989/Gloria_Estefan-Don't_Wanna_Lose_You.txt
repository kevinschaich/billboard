Sometimes it's hard
To make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here

I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide

So open your eyes
And see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever

Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
Forever

We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time and I hope
That's the way it will stay

It's all up to you
To tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know

That I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever and ever

Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
Forever, forever, yeah, yeah

Don't wanna lose you, lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you
Dont' wanna lose you
