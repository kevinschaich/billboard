Get busy

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (ooh)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (oh)
That's my prerogative

They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative

They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Gettin' girls is how I live

Some messy questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't undersand me
Or really don't know the deal

About a brother
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I win this fight, sing!

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (oh)
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
It's my prerogative

It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing, I'm doing for you

Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Egotrips is not my thing

All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothing wrong
In spreading myself around, sing

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
I don't need (I don't need) permission, make my own decisions (my own decisions)
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
It's my prerogative

I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
I can live my life (It's my prerogative)
And I'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)
Tell me, tell me

Why can't I live my life (live my life)
Without all of the things that people say?

Yo, Teddy kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

Everybody's talking (everybody's talking) all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
(Why don't they just let me live?)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (everybody's talking) 
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

What is this a blizzard
That I can't have money in pocket and people not talk about me?
This world is a trip, I don't know what's goin' on these days
Got this person over here talkin' 'bout me
Hey, listen this is my prerogative, I can do what I want to
I made this money, you didn't
Right, Ted?
We outta here

It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
It's my prerogative
It's my prerogative, can't you see baby doll
