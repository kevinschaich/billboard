I can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real

Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'round's killin' me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed

Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I won't make it
On my own
No one likes
To be alone

She drives me crazy (uh uh)
Like no one else (uh uh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (uh uh)

She drives me crazy (uh uh)
Like no one else (uh uh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (uh uh)

She drives me crazy (uh uh)
Like no one else (uh uh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (uh uh)
