Got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man, they're really coming back

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday 
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your light
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe

I don't need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back
And makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you, oh oh

(Heaven isn't too far away)
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

(Heaven)
Whoa, ohh
(Heaven)
Whoa, ohh
(Heaven)
It's not too far away, oh oh
Whoa, ohh
Yeah
