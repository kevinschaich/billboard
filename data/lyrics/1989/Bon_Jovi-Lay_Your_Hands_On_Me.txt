"They say that to really free your body
You've got to free your mind
So come on
Check this out"

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Come on!

If you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards out on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we've made are meant for breaking

What you get ain't always what you see
But satisfaction is guaranteed
They say what you give is always what you need, whoa-whoa
So if you want me to lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
All you gotta do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Now listen up!

I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get up off the ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down

Everything you want is what I need
Your satisfaction is, uh, guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever come for free, no-oh-oh
If you want me to lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
All you gotta do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me

Now now now baby
Don't you know I only aim to please?
If you want me to lay my hands on you, whoa-whoa-whoa

(What you gotta do is)
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
(Everybody gonna help me now)
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me

Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh, lay your hands on me
Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh, lay your hands on me

Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
