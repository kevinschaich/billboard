I'm not aware of too many things 
I know what I know, if you know what I mean 
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box 
Religion is the smile on a dog 
I'm not aware of too many things 
I know what I know, if you know what I mean, d-doo yeah 

Choke me in the shallow waters 
Before I get too deep 

What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what?
What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are, or? 

Oh, I'm not aware of too many things 
I know what I know, if you know what I mean 
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks 
Religion is a light in the fog 
I'm not aware of too many things 
I know what I know, if you know what I mean, d-doo yeah 

Choke me in the shallow water 
Before I get too deep 

What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what? 
What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what? 

What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what? 
What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what you are, and? 

What I am is what I am 
Are you what you are or what? 

Don't let me get too deep 
Don't let me get too deep 
Don't let me get too deep 
Don't let me get too deep 

Choke me in the shallow water 
Before I get too deep 
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep 

Choke me in the shallow water 
Before I get too deep 
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
