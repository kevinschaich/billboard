Even though it's been so long
My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you

I can see the love shining in your eyes
And it comes as such a sweet surprise
If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you baby
A love like ours will never end
Just touch me and we're there again

Just one night
And we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do
Hold on tight
And whatever comes our way we're gonna make it through

If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you
And I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
All the tender love you gave me
When a feeling gets this strong
You know the real thing come along

And I miss you
I miss you like crazy baby
Only your sweet love can save me
I miss you like crazy
A love like ours will never end
Just touch me and we're there again
Miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
