I don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong, and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

My head is full of magic, baby
And I can't share this with you
Feel I'm on a cross again, lately
But there's nothing to do with you

I'm alive, so alive
I'm alive, so alive

Your strut makes me crazy
Makes me see you more clearly
Oh, baby, now I can see you
Wish I could stop
Switch off the clock
Make it all happen for you

I'm alive, so alive
I'm alive, so alive

I don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong, and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

My head is full of magic, baby
And I can't share this with you
I feel I'm on top again, baby
That's got everything to do with you

I'm alive, so alive
I'm alive, so alive
