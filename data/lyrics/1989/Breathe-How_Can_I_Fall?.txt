Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart is not always there
What more can I say to you?

Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yes, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?

Now I hold this line
I know the choice to leave is mine
I can't help what I feel inside
What more can I say?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

I'll follow through, I'll say I do
When the time is far more right for you
I'll make that move, and when I do
Will I doubt again, the way I do?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

Just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall, I fall, I fall?
How can I fall for you?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons
