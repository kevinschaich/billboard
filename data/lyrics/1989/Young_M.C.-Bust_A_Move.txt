Bust it

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Try to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous

OK smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

(Oh, huh, yeah, huh, oh huh, yeah, huh)
Just bust a move
(Huh yeah, huh yeah, uh huh yeah huh)

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!"
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Just bust a move
(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it)

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way."

Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Just bust a move
(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Break it down for me fellas

(Oh, huh, yeah, huh, oh huh, hey, yeah)
(Uh uh, hey. yeah, huh uh uh uh)

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

You say neato, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it) Just bust a move
(If you want it, you got it)
(If you want it, baby, you got it)  Move it, boy

(Ha ha ha hey, ah ha yeah ha)
(Ha hey, ha yeah, huh huh hey hey, yeah)
