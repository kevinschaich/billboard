Little child
Dry your crying eyes
How can I explain
The fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born
Into this evil world
Where man is killing man
And no one knows just why

What have we become?
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

Little child
You must show the way
To a better day
For all the young
'Cause you were born
For the world to see
That we all can live
With love and peace

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

What have we become?
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children fight
Let them know it ain't right

When the children pray
Let them know the way
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins
