Red roses, temptation, 
You make the most of a ify situation. 
I'm weighing my decision 
who's to say if it's love,or if it isn't? 
Only time will tell 
Just how well I'll get to know you. 
Don't mean to lead you on, 
But I want to take it slowly, slowly. 

Don't rush me 
I've made that mistake before, ah. 
Don't rush me. 
This love could be so much more 
It's well worth the waiting for 
Desire can mean danger, 
I wanna lover, not another stranger 
I'm saving all my passion, 
Who's to say if its love, or just attraction? 
Only time will tell 
Just how well I'll get to know you. 
Don't mean to lead you on, But I want to take it slowly, slowly. 

And my resistance is weakening,weakening everytime we touch. 
Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of. 

Don't rush me. 
I've made that mistake before, oh yeah. 
Don't rush me. This love could be so much more, 
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah. 
My resistance is weakening 
every time we touch, 
cause baby you've got everything, 
everything That I've been dreaming of.

Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before,

It's well worth the waiting for. 
Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before, 
oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more, 
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah.
