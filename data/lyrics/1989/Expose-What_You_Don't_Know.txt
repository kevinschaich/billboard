No is not an answer
One that I might try to understand, you see
Love is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me

Can you feel it (feel it) or can't you see? (can't you see?)
I'll never love someone as much I know
When you see me (see me), it's what you'll get (what you'll get)
Until I know it's real, it won't change how I feel

CHORUS:
What you don't know might hurt you
What you don't know
If you don't know, it won't hurt you
What you don't know

You, you play with fire
I know one day, you're gonna be the one to burn
Love is like a game
What goes around, comes around, you wait your turn

It's a feeling (feeling) to change with time (change with time)
We'll always be together, wait and see
If you know me (know me), that's what you'll get (what you'll get)
Until I know it's real, it won't change how I feel

CHORUS (2x)

INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE

What you don't know no never know
What you don't know no never know
What you don't know no never know
What you don't know no never know

CHORUS (2x)

(What you don't know)
So, baby, what you don't know won't hurt you now
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no no no
And if you don't know, you won't let go
What you don't know

Na na na na, whoa whoa, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, whoa whoa, na na na
Na na na na
(repeat and fade out)
