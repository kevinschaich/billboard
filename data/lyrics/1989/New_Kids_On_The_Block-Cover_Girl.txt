I get up in the morning and I see your face, girl
You're looking so good, everything's in place
Don't you know I could never leave your side girl
Won't you stay here with me and be my bride?

Don't you your my kind, your just what i like
Girl you're everything, don't you know you're alright
The only girl I've always needeed for so long

Chorus:
Oh,oh-oh, she's my cover girl
Oh,oh-oh,oh-oh
Oh,oh-oh,she's my cover girl
Oh,oh-oh,oh-oh

When I look through the pages of a magazine
Still, your pretty face is the prettiest I've seen
Don't you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You're my everything

(Repeat Chorus twice)

It's alright
Oh, yeah, it's out of sight
Let me say it's alright
Ah, yeah!

Don't you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You're my everthing

(Chorus and fade)
