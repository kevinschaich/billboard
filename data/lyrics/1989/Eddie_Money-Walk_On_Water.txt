Well if I could walk on water 
And if I could find some way to prove 
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is so true 

(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...) 

Well I'm no angel, now, I'll admit 
I made a few bad moves I should regret 
I hurt you once or so you said 
Just one more chance is all you get

Didn't mean to do you wrong again 
Worse things have been done by better men 
Baby, baby, don't, don't treat me this way 
I know, yes, I've got to pay now, I'm still paying 

Well if I could walk on water 
And if I could find some way to prove 
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true 

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh 

All along, I told you lies 
To err is human, forgive is divine 
Don't be a fool, don't settle the score 
Cause I can't take it no more, I can't take it 

Well if I could walk on water 
And if I could find some way to prove 
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true 
Well, if I could walk on water (if I could) 
Is that what I'm gonna have to do?
If I could walk on water, would be you believe in me?
My love is so true 

(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...) 
Do I have to walk, walk, walk on water for you 

Hey baby, baby, there's a little time
Let's spend it together 
We'll get over what we left behind
There's our future together 
Yeah, well, let's stay together 

I keep walking and walking and walking
For you, for you

Well if I could walk on water 
And if I could find some way to prove 
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true

My love is so true
Do I have to walk, oh, walk on water for you?
Baby, please

If I had to walk, girl 
If I had to walk, walk, walk 
Do I have to walk on water, walk on water for you?

Do I have to walk on water?
Do I have to find some way to prove?
Do I have to walk on water, walk on water for you?

Do I have to walk on water?
Do I have to find some way to prove?
Yeah, yeah, walk on water, walk on water for you...
