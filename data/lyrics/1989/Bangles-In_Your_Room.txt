I love it in your room at night
You're the only one who gets through to me
In the warm glow of the candlelight
Oh, I wonder what you're gonna do to me
In your Room
I come alive when I'm with you
I'll do anything you want me to
In your room

I love it in your room all day
When you're gone I like to try on all your clothes
You won't regret it if you let me stay
I'll teach you everything that a boy should know
In your room
I'm alive when I'm with you
Gonna make your dreams come true
In your room

I feel good in your room
Let's lock the world out
Feels so good when we kiss
Nobody ever made me crazy like this

I'll do anything you want me to
I only want to be with you
In your room
In your room
