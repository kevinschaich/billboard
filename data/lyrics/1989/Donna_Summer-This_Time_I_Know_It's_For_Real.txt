What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I stand in line
One of a million admiring eyes

Walk a tight rope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, oh baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

Should I write or call you home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you

Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block long enough to know
This time I know it's for real, ooh baby

This time, this time
This time, this time, oh baby
This time, this time, oh baby

Walk a tight rope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, oh baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block long enough to know
This time I know it's for real
