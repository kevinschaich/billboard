If you want something done, 
You've got to do it yourself
Ow! Uh!
Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
(All on our own)
Heart-soul, d-d-dance!
(All on our own)

If I was you, and you were me
You wanna be winning
If you want something bad, yo
You gotta wanna give your all

'Cause I believe, so much in we
And no we're not kidding
If you feel the same as me, yo
You gotta wanna take the ball

Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)

Now can't you see 
That all we need to be a go-getter
Gotta make your own decisions
You've gotta go for what ya know

There comes a time in our lives
You wanna be bigger
Gotta keep, keep on pushing, 
You've gotta learn to take control, yeah

Now I've found out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

Heart-soul, d-d-dance!

Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters
And they're in control

Had em throwing a party
For a bunch of children
While all the while
The slime was under the building

So they packed up, regrouped
Got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed their proton packs
Off their backs and they split

Found out about Vigo
The master of evil
Try to battle my boys
That's not legal

(Oh-we-oh) They're in control
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)
I said they're in control
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
We've got, we've got, we've got
We've got, we've got, we've got
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're the Ghostbusters and they're in control

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta, take it home 
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

(Oh-we-oh) OW!
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)
(Oh-we-oh) Uh!
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)

Too hot to handle
(Oh-we-oh)
Too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters
(Oh-we-oh)
