If I could turn back time
If I could find a way 
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did 
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you 
I didn't wanna let you go 
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
You took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door, I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

Ooohh

If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
Ooh baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry
Ooohh

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time (turn back time)
If I could find a way (find a way)
Then baby, maybe, maybe
You'd stay

Reach the stars
If I could reach the stars
