Ain't there something I can give you 
In exchange for everything you give to me 
Read my mind and make me feel just fine 
When I think my peace of mind is out 
of reach 

The scales are sometimes unbalanced 
And you bear the weight of all that has to be 
I hope you see that you can lean on me 
And together we can calm a stormy sea 

We love so strong and so unselfishly 
And I tell you now that I made a vow 
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby 
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow 
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey 

Everybody's got opinions 
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end 
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill 
Everybody's gonna have to think again 

We love so strong and so unselfishly 
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on 
Giving you the best that I got, baby 
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on 
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby 

Somebody understands me 
Somebody gave his heart to me 
I stumbled my whole life long 
Always on my own, now I'm home 

My weary mind is rested 
And I feel as if my home is in your arms 
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song 
And I think I want to sing it forever 

We love so strong and so unselfishly 
And I made a vow so I tell you now 
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby 
I bet everything on my wedding ring 
I'm giving you the best that I got, 
givin' it to you baby
