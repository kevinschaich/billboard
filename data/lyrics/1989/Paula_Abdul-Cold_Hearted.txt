He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool now

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And runnin' with the crowd

You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
When he's out?

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool now

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up
To check that you were waiting by the phone

All the world's a candy store
He's been trick-or-treating
When it comes to true love, girl
With him, there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool now

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better, girl
He's c-cold as ice

(Cold as ice)
(He's cold as ice)
(He's cold as ice)

C-c-c-cold-hearted
Ooh ah ahh
C-c-c-cold-hearted
Sssssssnake

C-c-c-cold-hearted
Ooh ah ahh
C-c-c-cold-hearted
Sssssssnake

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool

Ooh, oh
Look into his eyes
Ooh, oh
He's been tellin' lies
Ooh, oh
He don't play by the rules
Ooh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh
Girl, don't play the fool
