Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Oh, crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defense

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up and don't give in
You may just be okay

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) It's too late when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(Say it loud) Don't give up, don't give in
(Say it clear) Don't wait til it's too late
