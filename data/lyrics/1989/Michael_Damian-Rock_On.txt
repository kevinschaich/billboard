Hey kids, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh my soul
Hey kids, boogie too, did ya?

Hey shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
(James Dean)
Jimmy Dean, rock on

Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on

Hey kid, rock and roll (rock on)
Rock on
Hey shout, summertime blues (rock on)
Rock on

Hey kid, boogie too (rock on)
Rock on
Hey kid, rock and roll (rock on)
Rock on

Hey kid, boogie too
