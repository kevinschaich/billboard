For the life of me
I never thought that it could be
The way it stands right now
Emotions running high
Every night I wish that I
Could tell you how I feel
Those words are here in my heart
Oh but there is just one missing part

How to put it together
How to say it right
And let you know that
Every night

I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping baby you will be there
I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping baby you will be there

Let me take time out
To try and find out
If this could be real
Cause reality scares me
I've been living a fantasy
How should I feel

Those words are here in my heart
Oh but there is just one missing part

How to put it together
How to say it right
And let you know that
Every night

I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping baby you will be there
I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping baby you will be there
