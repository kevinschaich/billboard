Time Will Never Lose
memories We Choose
choices That We`ve
made For Love

voices In My Head
they Call Me Away
you Were Right Beside Me
i`m In Love

maybe I Should Have Known It
maybe I Should Have Seen
but I Stayed Lost In My Dreams

now That You`re Gone

(Chorus)
i Remember Holding You
feeling Felt So Right
now I Find I`m Reaching Out
in The Middle Of The Night
all Those Things
i Should Have Said
now My Chance Is Gone
all Alone I`m Reaching Out
even Though I Know It`s
wrong, So Wrong

we Will Never Know
what My Heart Will Never Show
i Will Keep It All Inside

somehow When I Tried
you Knew That I Lied
in My Heart I Feel Untrue

maybe I Should Have Known It
maybe I Should Have Seen
but I`m Still Lost In My Dreams

now That You`re Gone

(Chorus)

oh, I Know, I Know
i Know, I Know It`s Wrong

all The Times I Should Have Seen
everything You Meant To Me
now I Only Hold You In My Dreams

(Chorus)

i Remember Holding You
i Remember Holding You
(I Know, I Know
i Know, I Know It`s Wrong)

i Remember Holding You
i Remember Holding You
i Remember Holding You
(Feeling Felt So Right)
felt So Right

all Those Things
i Should Have Said
(Oh, No, No, Yeah, Yeah)

i Remember Holding You
