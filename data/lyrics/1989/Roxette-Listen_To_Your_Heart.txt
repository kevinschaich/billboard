I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns to dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before...

Oh, listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart, before
You tell him goodbye

(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart) Oh, take a listen to it, oh
(Listen to your heart) Take a, take a listen
(Listen to your heart) Ooh yeah
(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, ooh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart)
