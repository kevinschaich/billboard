I know they say you can't go home again. 
I just had to come back one last time. 
Ma’am I know you don’t know me from Adam. 
But these handprints on the front steps are mine. 
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom 
is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar. 
And I bet you didn’t know under that live oak 
my favorite dog is buried in the yard. 

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it 
this brokenness inside me might start healing. 
Out here its like I’m someone else, 
I thought that maybe I could find myself 
if I could just come in I swear I’ll leave. 
Won’t take nothing but a memory 
from the house that built me. 

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years. 
From ‘Better Homes and Garden’ magazines. 
Plans were drawn, concrete poured, 
and nail by nail and board by board 
Daddy gave life to mama’s dream. 

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it 
this brokenness inside me might start healing. 
Out here its like I’m someone else, 
I thought that maybe I could find myself. 
If I could just come in I swear I’ll leave. 
Won’t take nothing but a memory 
from the house that built me. 

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can. 
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am. 

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it 
this brokenness inside me might start healing. 
Out here its like I’m someone else, 
I thought that maybe I could find myself. 
If I could walk around I swear I’ll leave. 
Won’t take nothing but a memory 
from the house that built me.
