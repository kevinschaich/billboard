Eh, eh, eh

Baby, you're looking fine
I have you open all night like an Ihop
I take you home baby let you keep me company
You gimme some of you, I give you some of me

You look good, baby, must taste heavenly
I'm pretty sure that you got your own recipe
So pick it up, pick it up, yeah I like you
I just can't get enough, I gotta drive through

Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you all night
Have it your way, foreplay, before I feed your appetite 

Let me get my ticket, baby, let me get in line
I can tell the way you like it baby, supersize
Hold on, you got yours, let me give mine
I ain't leave until they turn over the 'Closed' sign
Check it!

Number one, I take two number threes
That’s a whole lot of you and a side of me
Now is a fool of myself to want you full of me
And if there’s room for dessert, then I want a piece

Baby get my order right, no errors
I’ma touch you in all the right areas
I can feed you, you can feed me
Girl, deliver that to me, come see me

Cause its me, you, you, me, me, you all night
Have it your way, foreplay, before I feed your appetite

Do you like it well done, cause I do it well
Cause I’m well seasoned if you couldn’t tell
Now let me walk into your body till you hear me out
And turn me on, my baby, don’t you cut me out
