Lady GaGa:
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

(K-kinda busy) K-kinda busy
(K-kinda busy) K-kinda busy
(K-kinda busy) Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You shoulda made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

(Eh x11)
Stop telephonin' me (Stop telephonin' me)
(Eh x10)
I'm busy （I'm busy）
(Eh x10)
Stop telephonin' me (Stop telephonin' me)
(Eh x11)

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call when you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Beyoncé:
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home, 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, Sorry, I cannot answer

Lady GaGa:
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone ri-ringing

Beyoncé:
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station (Station...)
Tonight, I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin' (Tonight, I'm dancin')

Both:
'Cause I'll be dancin' (Tonight, I'm dancin')
'Cause I'll be dancin' (Tonight, I'm dancin')
Tonight, I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

(Eh x11) 
(Stop telephonin' me) Stop telephonin' me 
(Eh x10) 
(I'm busy) I'm busy 
(Eh x10)
(Stop telephonin' me) Stop telephonin' me 
(Eh x11) （I'm busy）

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
(D-D-DD-Darkchild)
My telephone
M-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone
M-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
