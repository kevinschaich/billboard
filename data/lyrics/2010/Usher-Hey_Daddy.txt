Usher Baby
I just wanna get your attention
I really wanna be your love in your head
Coz when I got you don’t wanna get some yeah
But girl that’s only if you ain’t scared

(Refrain)
And I won’t knock or ring no bells
You just float bottom up in the air
I’ll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I’m walking all that I wanna hear

(Chorus)
Is you say Daddy’s home, home for me
And I know you’ve been waiting for this love in your day
You know your daddy’s home (daddy’s home), and it’s time to play (so it’s time to play)
So you ain’t got to give my loving away
So all my ladies say hey hey hey daddy

And girl tonight we’ll gonna do a lot of sexin’

You just float bottom up in the air
Said I’ll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I’m walking all that I wanna hear
