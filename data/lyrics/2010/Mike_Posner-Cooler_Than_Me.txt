If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name, and
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear them around like it ain't shh
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

You got your highbrow switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

'Cause it sure seems (it sure seems)
You got no doubt (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds.
