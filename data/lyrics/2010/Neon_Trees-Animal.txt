Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kicking in
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
I want to run and hide
I do it every time
You're killing me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand
Oh I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again (here we go again)

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting

Here we go again
Oh oh here we go again
Oh oh here we go again
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
