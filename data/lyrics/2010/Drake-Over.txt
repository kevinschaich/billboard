I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over


Alright bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it


I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over


One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that 
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it


I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over
