Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this."
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Bruno Mars
Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh

Travie McCoy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
So bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Buy everything
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
What up, Oprah! Ha ha!

Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
