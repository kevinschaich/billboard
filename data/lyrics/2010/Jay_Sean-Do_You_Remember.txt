Hey! Jay Sean
Yeah! Sean Paul
Lil Jon!
This one right here is for all the ladies
Ladies who want to take it back
Dur dirty ay
Holler at them Jay

I've been thinking about you
And how we used to be then
Back when it didn't have to end
we could start again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time, let's make new memories (let's go)

Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back

(Yo Jay, Sing for these ladies!)

So long since you've been missing
It's good to see you again
How you, how you doing
And how about we don't let this happen again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time, let's make new memories

Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)

Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me
