Hey, hey, hey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains 
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
And so I went and let you blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny 

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tonight
