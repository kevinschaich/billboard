MMMM better...MMMM better... 
Absolutely no one that knows me better 
No one that can make me feel sooo goooood 
How did we stay so long together? 
When everybody, everybody said we never would 
And just when I, I start to think they're right 
That love has died... 

Chorus: 
There you go making my heart beat again, 
heart beat again, 
heart beat again 
There you go making me feel like a kid 
Won't you do it and do it one time? 
There you go pulling me right back in, 
right back in, 
right back in 
And i know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo 

I'm stuck on you 
Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby we're stuck like glue 
Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby we're stuck like glue 

Some days I don't feel like trying 
Some days you know I wanna just give up 
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night 
Had enough 
You give me that look 
"I'm sorry baby let's make up" 
You do that thing that makes me laugh 
And just like that... 

Chorus: 
There you go making my heart beat again, 
heart beat again, 
heart beat again 
There you go making me feel like a kid 
Won't you do it and do it one time 
There you go pulling me right back in, 
right back in, 
right back in 
And i know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo 

I'm stuck on you 
Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby we're stuck like glue 
Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby were stuck like glue 


Whutooo Whutoo 

You almost stay out, too stuck together from the ATL 
Whutooo Whutoo 
Feeling kinda sick? 
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick 

I say 
Whutooo Whutoo 
Whatcha gonna do with that? 
Whutooo Whutoo 
Come on over here with that 
Sugar sticky sweet stuff 
Come on give me that stuff 
Everybody wants some 
melodies that get stuck 

Up in your head 
whutooo whutooo 

Up in your head 
whutooo whutooo 

Up in your head 
whutooo whutooo 

Up in your head 
whutooo whutooo 
whuthoo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me together, say, it's all I wanna do 
I said 

Chorus: 
There you go making my heart beat again, 
heart beat again, 
heart beat again 
There you go making me feel like a kid 
Won't you do it and do it one time 
There you go pulling me right back in, 
right back in, 
right back in 
And i know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo 

There you go making my heart beat again, 
heart beat again, 
heart beat again 
There you go making me feel like a kid 
Won't you do it and do it one time 
There you go pulling me right back in, 
right back in, 
right back in 
And i know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo 
I'm stuck on you 

Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby we're stuck like glue 
Whutooo whutooo 
Stuck like glue 
You and me baby were stuck like glue 
Whutooo whutooo 
stuck like glue 
you and me baby we're stuck like glue
