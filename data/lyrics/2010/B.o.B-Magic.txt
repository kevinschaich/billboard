I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me!

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy

I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'?"

So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9

I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin' baby)

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me!

Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow

See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia

I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo

I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin' baby)

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me!
