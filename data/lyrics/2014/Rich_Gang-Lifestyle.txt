Young Thug
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like a beginner and this only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'

Million 5 on a Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the Phoenix sun
Nigga servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks
I won't do nothin' with the bitch, she can't even get me horny
Somethin' wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she  clean
'Cause with me and my gross,





 Can't get up late ke that caught up like that, no wayx2
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said I said I'm horny)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawnin'
Hey, think this a show bitch you performin'
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
I'mma run up them bands, I'll take out their funds, bitch
I got a moms bitch, she got a moms bitch
I got sisters and brothers to feed
I ain't goin' out like no idiot, I'm a OG

Young Thug
Still screamin' "Fuck the other side"
I'ma ride for my nigga, aye
And I'ma die for my nigga, aye
Ain't gonna be latching on my niggas aye
Nigga couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'ma live my life like Bennie, R.I.P. my brother Bennie
I stack my racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake up when Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole 'nother league
I ain't got aids but I swear to God I would bleed 'til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that coffin with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy
I'm bleedin' red like a devil, I see these bitches plotting
They wanna know how I got M's and I didn't finish college

Rich Homie Quan
I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up
I'm Willie B beating on my chest, in the jungle, aye
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way
Thugger Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, I'll do her, I want a head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day
I'm skatin', like that nigga Lupe
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee
Hey, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste
