Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, how do we
I can't take it

'Cause baby, every time I love you
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life in out baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good

Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

Stand united through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, and it's driving me crazy
Cause Baby, love never felt so good

Aww baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if its mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aww baby love never felt so good (so good)
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And tonight that feels good (feels good)
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love yo
It's in and out my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
'Cause it's in and out my life and it's driving me crazy
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

(Felt so good) aw yeah
Never felt so good
(Felt so good)
Never felt so good
(Never felt so good) yeah yeah
Never felt so good (Never felt so good) uh huh
Never felt so good

Alright that's fine...
