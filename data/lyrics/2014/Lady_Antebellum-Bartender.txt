8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on, it ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
Kiss the past goodbye

What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let 'em invite a couple more
But before it goes too far
I'll let me down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

I'm feeling that close
I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot

Hey bartender
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
