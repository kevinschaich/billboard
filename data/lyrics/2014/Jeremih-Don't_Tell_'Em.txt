Mustard on the beat, ho!

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
You don't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em

Know you say you down with it
Won't tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I'm from Chicago, I like the full Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring 'em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' put in miles
Don't you worry 'bout it might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
You don't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em

Dely fool, fool with it
But you know I know what to do with it
I get it that girl I'm talking laps
You said you got to pull with it
And she say she with your best friends
Then let me be down with
You know you feeling now so press play
Just keep that ass with
Only with you got it feel like this
Ooh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving and grabbing the rhythm of the hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Throw it up 9-3-4, 8-6-1-6
I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's wet and fresh
It's that Twitter pussy I met on the internet
On my late-night thirsty, 'cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no belly
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn't cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from uno to ocho

Only you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why?
Loving and grabbing the rhythm of the hips

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
You don't even gotta tell 'em

You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
