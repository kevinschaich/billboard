Beyoncé
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

Jay-Z
Hold up
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house time back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, wanna see all that shit I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

Beyoncé
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I've been drinking watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now)
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
