Boom, boom, boom clap

You're picture perfect blue, sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug, under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins

This must be love

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

No silver or no gold could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do, I'll fall right into you
We're going under, cast the spell, just say the word

I feel your love

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, ah

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom clap, the sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
