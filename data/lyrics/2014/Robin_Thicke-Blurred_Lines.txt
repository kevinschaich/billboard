One thing I ask you
Let me be the one you back that ass into (come on)
Go from Malibu to Paribu
Yeah, I had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you

So hit me up when you passing through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on, even when you dress casual
I mean it's not almost unbearable

Then, honey, you're not there when I'm
With my foresight bitch you pay me by
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

So I jail watch (jail watch)
Hand wave (hand wave) for you to salute
And choose but you didn't pick
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
But I'm a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

Shake the vibe, get down
(Ooh) Get up

Do it like it hurt
Like it hurt
What you doing like work
Hey yeah, hey (everybody get up)

Baby, can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur (a-ha)

No more pretending (hey, hey, hey) (a-ha)
'Cause now you in it (hey, hey, hey) (a-ha)
Here's our beginning (hey, hey, hey) (a-ha)
I always wanted a good girl
