Shakira
I left a note on my bedpost
Said "Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes."
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel, yeah
Gotta hold on me I’ve never met someone so different

Oh here we go
He a part of me now, He a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can’t remember to forget you

Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight

Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can’t remember to forget you

I can’t remember to forget you

Rihanna
I go back again, fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I’m trying to say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me

Both
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

Shakira
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

Rihanna
I can’t remember to forget you

Shakira
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

Rihanna
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight

Shakira
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can’t remember to forget you

I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I do anything for that boy
I’d give my last dime to hold him tonight
I do anything for that boy

Rihanna
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I do anything for that boy
I’d give my last dime to hold him tonight
I do anything for that boy
