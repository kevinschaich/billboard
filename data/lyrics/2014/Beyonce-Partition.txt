Lemme hear you say "Hey, Miss Carter!" (Hey, Miss Carter!)
Say "Hey, Miss Carter!" (Hey, Miss Carter!)
Gimme some!

"Yoncé":

See me up in the club with fifty-leven girls;
Posted in the back, got my fangs in my grill...
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sitting low,
And every boy in here with me got that smoke,
And every girl in here got to look me up and down;
All on Instagram, cake by the pound...
Circulate the image every time I come around;
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe...

Brought this all for you, just walk my way...
(Just tell me how it's looking, babe, just tell how it's looking, babe...)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim...
(And tell me how it's looking, babe...) How it's lookin', babe... (Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin' babe...)

Drop the bass - mane, the bass get lower;
Radio say speed it up, I just go slower...
High like treble, pumping on the mids;
No man ain't never seen a booty like this...
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I just write another one...
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker;
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...

"Beyoncé, Beyoncé?"
"Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?"
"Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!"

"Partition":

Driver, roll up the partition, please...

Driver, roll up the partition, please;
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up;
We ain't even gon' make it to this club...
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged;
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck...
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse;
He Monica Lewinskied all on my gown...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, didn't bring the towel;
Whoa baby, baby, we better slow it down...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...

Driver, roll up the partition fast...

Driver, roll up the partition fast;
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash...
Handprints and footprints on my glass,
Handprints and good grips all on my ass...
Private show, with the music blasting;
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty...
Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash;
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur;
Whoa baby, baby, be sweatin' out my hair...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...

Hajiba Fahmy:
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe? Le sexe. Je veux dire, l’activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça? 
Tu ne t’interesses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c’est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.

Beyoncé:
Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...
