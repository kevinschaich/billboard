Baby let me put your panties to the side
I'ma make you feel alright
‘Cause I'ma give you what you need, yeah
Mami you remind me of something
I don’t know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me
Alright, you remind me of something
I don’t know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

Uh, on the real no lie
I don’t know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right
B set put us to the left
Don’t listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain’t got no kids
We ain’t leaving ’til there ain’t no more left
Can’t see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go and show it
Looking for the after party, where to go at?
Go on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said

Mami you remind me of something
I don’t know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me
Alright, you remind me of something
I don’t know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

Baby if you know what it is
On the real, can’t lie, man just my type
Hands in the air looking for bitch right now
On the real, can’t lie, man just my type

Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don’t really care who you came with
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain’t know where to land
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I put your bad ass in detention

Baby let me put your panties to the side

‘Cause I'ma give you what you need, yeah
Mami you remind me of something
I don’t know what it is
You remind me of something

Alright, you remind me of something

You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

Baby if you know what it is
On the real, can’t lie, man just my type
Hands in the air looking for bitch right now
On the real, can’t lie, man just my type

Oh baby show me, show me something
Tomorrow I might be hungover, that don't mean nothing
See you all night long, I've been wrong
Baby show me something

Baby let me put your panties to the side
