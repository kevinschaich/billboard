Goin 95 burning down 129 yeah
Looking for the law, while push my luck
Shes ridin shot gun like it ain't no thing 
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like "y'all wassup"
Tonight is bottoms up up
Throw it on down 
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back

Make ya wanna slide on in like "Girl, what’s up"
