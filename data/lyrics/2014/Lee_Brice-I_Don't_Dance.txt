I’ll never settle down, 
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man, 
just ask anyone

I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause, I don’t dance

Love’s never come my way, 
I’ve never been this far
'Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
'Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
'Cause, I don’t dance

Oh,
No..

Oooh…
