You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into
A weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash
Of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

Nothing's gonna hurt you
The way that words do
And they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside
No sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say
What you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bowed down to the mighty
Don't run
Stop holding your tongue

Maybe there's a way out
Of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days
You can let the light in
Show me
How big your brave is

Say
What you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave

Innocence your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say
What you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave

Yeah
oh
