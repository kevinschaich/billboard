I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Hoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

I am a fire, you're gasoline
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames 
Only one more time

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Hoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
(Night night night night night...)

Are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Hoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
