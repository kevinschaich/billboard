I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black, that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah we'll work it out
I'll be doing this, if you had a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah I worked it out
I'll be doing this, if you had a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I got my mind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopholes
But Mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said "do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them, 'cause I'm so devout
Till the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah

I got my mind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

Ooh, we all want the same thing
Ooh, we all run for something
Run for God, for fate
For love, for hate
For gold, for rust
For diamonds, for dust

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black, that's makin' you run 

I got my mind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black, that's makin' you run 
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yes we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
Till the love runs out
