Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire

I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
La la, la la la...
La la, la la la...
I find a way to block it, I go
La la, la la la...
La la, la la la...

Yes our love is running out of time
I won't count the hours, rather be a coward
When our words collide
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind

I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it, I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it, oh
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it, I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
