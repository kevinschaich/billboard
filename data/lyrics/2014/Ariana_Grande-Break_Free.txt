If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever (yeah, babe)
On the highway to hell, yeah (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby
(Oooh)

Thought on your body I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby!

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
