This is a story about control,
My control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready? I am.
'Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen, I did what people told me
Did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control - to get what I want
Control - I got to have a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
But now I know I've got to take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

That's right, I'm on my own,
I'll call my own shots, thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand
And lead you on this dance (control)
'Cause what I've got is because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world
Just wanna run my life
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

Free at last, out here on my own
Now control this
That's right, career moves
I do what's right for me
And me wants to groove
Is that okay?

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control (and I love it, that's right)
Control - now I've got a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't make me lose it
