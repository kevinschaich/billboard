No matter what you think you pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through

It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you, you

No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown

You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted (oh, oh, uh)

This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do

It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Shakedown, breakdown, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Oh, busted
Oh oh

Shakedown (breakdown), breakdown (takedown), takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown (takedown), takedown (shakedown)
You're busted (busted)

Shakedown (breakdown), breakdown (takedown), honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown (takedown), takedown (shakedown)
You're busted

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, takedown
Oh, you're busted

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Let down your guard
