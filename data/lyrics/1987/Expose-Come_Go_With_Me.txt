Feels the same every day
Come home from work late again
Work so hard and never play
I can't wait to take you far away

Don't you know (Don't you know)
Got to go (Got to go)
Pressure builds from everyone every day
Get away (Get away)
Come my way (Come my way)
When the day begins to end, then you're mine

Come go with me, oh
Make you feel alive
This night will last
Everlasting through the time
Come go with me, oh
Have no fears

Bring back the memories
I can take away the misery
Take my hand, we'll fly away
To our world that we can find today

Can you feel (Can you feel)
I'm for real (I'm for real)
Can I hold you by the fire in the night
Is it right (Is it right)
Hold me tight (Hold me tight)
When you look into my eyes in the light

Come go with me, oh
Make you feel alive
This night will last
Everlasting through the time (Come go with me)
Come go with me, oh
Have no fears
Two hearts in one
Eternal through the night

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Just come go with me
Don't let it end in sorrow
Love is our destiny

(Come go with me, come go with me)
I'll take you by the hand
And we'll find another land
(Come go with me, come go with me)
Oh, leave the world behind
The world of nine to five

Come go with me
Come go with me

Come go with me, yeah

Come go with me, oh
Make you feel alive
This night will last
Everlasting through the time (into the night)
Come go with me, oh (into the night)
Have no fears (into the night)
Two hearts in one
Eternal through the night (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Come go with me, oh (Get away with me tonight)
Make you feel alive (Stay with me tonight)
This night will last (I can, can, can)
Everlasting through the time (Can, can give you love)
Come go with me, oh (I can, can, can)
Have no fears (Can, can give you love)
Two hearts in one
Eternal through the night

Come go with me, oh (Get away with me tonight)
Make you feel alive (Stay with me tonight)
This night will last (I can, can, can)
Everlasting through the time (Can, can give you love)
Come go with me, oh (I can, can, can)
Have no fears (Can, can give you love)
Two hearts in one
Eternal through the night
