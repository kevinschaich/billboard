All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian
