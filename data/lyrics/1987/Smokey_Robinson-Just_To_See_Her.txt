Just to see her
Just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again
One more time

If I could feel her warm embrace
See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it, no
I can't fight it, oh
It's so hard to live without the love
She gave to me

Doesn't she know it?
I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she
Really needs me again?

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again

(Just to see her)
I want to see her
(Just to hold her)
Hold her, hold her, hold her
(Just to see her)
See her
(Just to touch her)
Touch her

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightens up my everyday
Makes me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again
(I've got to see her again)

(Just to see her)
It would, it would, it would
(Just to see her)
Make me feel so good
(Just to see her)
If I, if I could only see her again
(Just to see her again)

(Just to see her)
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
(Just to see her)
Oh, don't you know it's true?
(Just to see her)
If I could only see her again
