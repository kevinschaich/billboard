Na!
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right (Na!)
Just show your face in broad daylight (Na!)
I'm telling you on how I feel (Na!)
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill 
Sh'mon, na, sh'mon
Lay it on me, na, all right

Na!
I'm giving you on count of three (Na!)
To show your stuff or let it be (Na!)
I'm telling you just watch your mouth (Na!)
I know your game, what you're about
Na

Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true (Na!)
But, my friend, you have seen nothing
Just a-wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, sh'mon, na!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, na!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on, you know
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

Na, na!
The word is out, na, you're doin' wrong (Na!)
Gonna lock you up before too long (Na!)
Your lyin' eyes gonna tell you right (Na!)
So listen up, ah, don't make a fight (Na!)
Your talk is cheap; you're not a man (Na!)
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands, uh

Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true (Na!)
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just a-wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - sh'mon, na!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, na!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

Na!
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place (Na!)
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then a-won't you slap my face?

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - sh'mon, na!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, ah!
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know
(Bad, bad - really, really bad)

Woo! Woo! Woo!

You know I'm bad, I'm bad - sh'mon, ah!

You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again

You know I'm smooth, I'm bad
You know it
