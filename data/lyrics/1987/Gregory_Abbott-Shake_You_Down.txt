Oh, yeah

Girl, I've been watching you
From so far across the floor now, baby
That's nothing new
I've watched you so many times before now, baby

I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it's telling me
And you know, oh girl, that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy, now baby

(You read my mind) You know you did
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) Well, oh well
(I can give you all the loving you need) I'm gonna love you
(Come on, let me take you down) Oh, baby
(We'll go all the way to heaven)

Oh, I've been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do?
I can tell you've got your pride now, baby

(Oh) Come to me, well oh well (won't you come to me)
Let me ease your mind, oh babe
I've got the remedy, huh, yes I do
Now give me just a little time

(You read my mind)
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) I wanna rock you down
(I can give you all the loving you need) I'm gonna love you
(Come on, let me take you down) Well, oh well
(We'll go all the way to heaven)

Girl, I've been missing you
And you know, it's funny
Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you

I can't stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me, baby, when I'm holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know your near
Then you whisper in my ear
Oh baby, well, oh well

(You read my mind) You know you did
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) Oh, baby
(I can give you all the loving you need) Aah (Loving you'll need)
(Come on, let me take you down) Well, oh well
(We'll go all the way to heaven)

Eenie, meenie, minie, moe (you read my mind)
Come on, girl, let's start the show (girl, I wanna shake you down)
Aah, yeah (I can give you all the loving you need)
Roses are red and violets are blue
I'm gonna rock this town for you (come on, let me take you down)
Hey, baby (we'll go all the way to heaven)

Come on, sugar, let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on, baby, whisper in my ear

Come on, sugar, let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on, baby, whisper in my ear
