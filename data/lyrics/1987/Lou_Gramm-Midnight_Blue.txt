Ain't got no regrets
I ain't losin' track
Of which way I'm going
Ain't gonna double back, no

Don't want no misplay
Put on no display
An angel? no
But I know my way, oh yeah, oh

I used follow
Yeah, that's true
But my following days are over
Now I just gotta follow through

And I remember what my father said
He said "Son, life is simple
It's either cherry red or
Midnight blue, oh
Midnight blue (oh) oh"

You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the trouble boy
Lookin' for a double dare

I won't apologize for
The things I've done and said
But when I win your heart
I'm gonna paint it cherry red

I don't want to talk about it
What you do to me
I can't live without it

And you might think that
It's much too soon
For us to go this far
Into the midnight blue, oh
It's midnight blue (oh) oh

Things could be different
But that'd be a shame
'Cause I'm the one who could feel the sun
Right in the pouring rain

I won't say where
And I don't know when
But soon there's gonna come a day, baby
I'll be back again

Yeah, I'll be back for you
You see, I'm saving up my love

Midnight blue, oh
Into the midnight blue, oh
Another midnight blue, oh
The deepest midnight blue, oh

Into the midnight blue (oh) oh
Midnight blue, oh, oh yeah
Midnight blue, oh
The deepest midnight blue, oh, oh

Into the midnight blue
