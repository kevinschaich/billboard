Sometimes, people play with love
Falling in love is just a game
Don't think I don't know love
You'll never be alone again

(Let me) Show you how I feel
(Be the one) That I need so much
(Let me) Give you what is real
(Be the one) That I long to touch

Only you can make me feel this way
I'll give you all, come on, let's get away
This love I feel will never ever fade
I'll give you more and more so

(Let me, be the one) Hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one) You can trust me at anytime
(Let me, be the one) Give you all the love
(Let me be the one) To feel your tender touch


First time that I saw you there
Thought I knew you from before
Promise me you will never leave
'Cause I will never let you go

(Let me) Hold you close to me
(Be the one) Because our love is strong
(Let me) Feel the need in me
(Be the one) Together we belong

Only you can make me feel brand new
I can feel it in my heart, your love is true
Together, we are one instead of two
I want you more and more so

(Let me, be the one) To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one) You can trust me at anytime
(Let me, be the one) I want to give you all the love
(Let me be the one) And be the one


Only you can make me feel this way
I'll give you all, come on, let's get away
This love I feel will never ever fade
I'll give you more and more so

(Let me, be the one) To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one) You can trust me at anytime
(Let me, be the one) To give you all the love
(Let me be the one) And feel your tender touch

(Let me be the one) To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one) You can trust me at anytime
