Take me as I am
Put your hand in mine now and forever
Darling here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew 

It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you, and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more 

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own 

Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
'Cause I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove 

'Till there was you, you and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be 

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong
Do you believe a love could pass you by
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know 

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own 

I can't go on (I can't go on)
No, I can't go on

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on
Without somebody I can call my own

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on
If you could say your love

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, you'll never be alone
