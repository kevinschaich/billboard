Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

I know you think I'm not
Your picture perfect jewel
Who'll never break apart
When everything was cool

I needed to explore
And open up the door
But now I need you more

I'm sending out a message
A message so sincere
When I close my eyes
I need to feel you near

Can't get you off my mind
For leaving me this time
I'm still in love with you

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

If I had your attention
I'd tell you what I learned
Despite of good intentions
It's easy to get burned

I learned my lesson well
It's you I need to tell
This time I'm all for you

I need for you to trust me
To give me all your best
I'll prove just what your love means
Just put me to the test

This time I need to stay
Dont need to go away
I'm still in love with you

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

You're my morning sun
You're my shining star
You're my number one
Cross my broken heart

In your eyes I see
What you mean to me
You're my destiny

I'm sending out a message
A message so sincere
When I close my eyes
I need to feel you near

Can't get you off my mind
For leaving me this time
I'm still in love with you

You're my morning sun
You're my shining star
You're my number one
Cross my broken heart

In your eyes I see
What you mean to me
You're my destiny

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
Im going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
