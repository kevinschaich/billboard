The common road seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
Fills me within when we're together
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I -  I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I - will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh

It took so long, well I treasure now,
The love you gave to me
And when you smile, it warms my heart in need
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I - I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return, oh, baby
I - will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

You're taking me to the point of no return
(To the point of no return) oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return,
(Hey hey hey yeah) oh oh oh

I wanna be with you baby (ooh-wah ooh-wah)
I'm gonna be by your side (by your side)
I wanna be with you baby (ooh-wah ooh-wah)
I'm gonna love you every night

You're taking me to the point of no return
(Hey hey hey) oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return,
(C'mon and take me to the point)
(C'mon and take me to the point) oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return,
(No holding back)
(No holding back) oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return,
(Hey hey hey yeah) oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return
(Oh baby)
