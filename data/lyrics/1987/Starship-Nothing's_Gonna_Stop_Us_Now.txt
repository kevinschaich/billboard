Looking in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart
That I'm feeling for you

Let them say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand, baby
Don't ever look back

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Oh, no, I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you

Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes
Is what I'm gonna do

Let them say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby
Don't ever let go

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever, forever and ever, hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Nothing's gonna stop us, ooh, whoa, oh)

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now, oh, no, oh)

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Hey, baby, ah, no, oh, hey, baby)

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Nothing's gonna stop us, hey, baby, ooh, ooh)
Nothing's stop

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Hey, baby, nothing's gonna stop us now, yeah)
