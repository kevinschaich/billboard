I see your face cloud over like a little girl's
And your eyes have lost their shine
You whisper something softly
I'm not meant to hear
Baby tell me what's on your mind
I don't' care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds
I love you so much that it hurts inside
Are you listening
Please listen to me girl

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

I hear you on the telephone
With god knows who
Spilling out your heart for free
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
Girls that someone should be me

So many times I've tried to tell you
You just turn away
My life is changing so fast now
Leaves me lonely and afraid
Don't be afraid, no

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride

I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside
Don't let our love fade away
No matter what people say
I need you more and more each day

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
Love you so much baby
Tears me up inside
