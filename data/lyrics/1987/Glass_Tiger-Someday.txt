When I come home you telephone
To say you're waiting for me
I ask you why - I hear you cry
But you're still waiting for me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Now I'm alone, you telephone
To tell me you don't need me
I ask you why, you tell me lies
And say the truth would hurt me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Oh, oh... someday

Down in the street where lovers meet
That's where I'm waiting for you
In the streets where lovers meet
I'm still waiting for you

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)
Someday I'll be losing this fear
