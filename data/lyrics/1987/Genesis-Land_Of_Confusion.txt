I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well, this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
Well, everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
They're losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
And the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well, this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the names we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Stand up and let's start showing (Oh-oh-oh)
Just where our lives are going to
