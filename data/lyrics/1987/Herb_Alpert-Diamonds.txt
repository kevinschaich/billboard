You told me you love me
you told me you care

But when I'm around you
It's like I'm not there.
I need a reminder
Something I can see

Something on my finger shines so brightly.

Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

When you go
They stay with me until the end.
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best
Best friend

When you go
They stay with me until the end.

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.
Don't want your money

Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.

They say you need some roses
But roses do die

You gave me some candy
It melted
Nice try.
I'm not that demanding
I have simple taste

I just want a token that can't go to waste - Diamonds.

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.
