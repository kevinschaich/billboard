I, I was a game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all over him

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him

Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb...
