Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love

You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love

I wake up alone with it all
I wake up but only to fall

Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love
Big, big love
