Oh yeah

In France, a skinny man died of a big disease
With a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same

At home there are 17 year old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack and totin' a machine gun

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
U turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' U somebody died

A sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford 2 feed it
And yet we're sending people 2 the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time
Now he's doing horse - it's June

It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants 2 fly
But some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies
Oh why?

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see The Dawn?

Time

Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows and, and everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man ain't happy truly until a man truly dies
Oh why, oh why?
Sign "O" the times

Time

Sign "O" the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's 2 late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate
If it's a boy
