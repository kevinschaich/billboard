When lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry, we've been through this before
In every time, in every season
God knows I've tried, so please don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes?
This might be our last goodbye 
Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet
Again, somewhere, again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
This might be our last goodbye (Oh, oh, oh)
Carrie, Carrie, (oh) things they change my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet
Again

Oh, oh

Can't you see it in my eyes?
This might be our last goodbye (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, Carrie, Carrie
Oh, oh, things they change, Carrie, Carrie, Carrie (whoa)
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet
Again, oh, somewhere, again
When lights go down
