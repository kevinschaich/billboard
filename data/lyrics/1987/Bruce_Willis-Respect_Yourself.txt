If you disrespect everybody 
That you run into 
How in the world do you think 
Anybody 'sposed to respect you 

If you don't give a heck about 
The man with a bible in his hand 
Just get out the way and
Let the gentleman do his thing 

You're the kind of gentleman 
That wants everything their way 
Take the sheet off your face, boy 
It's a brand new day 
 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
If you don't respect yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna give a good 
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh 
Respect yourself 

If you're walking around thinking 
That the world owes you something 
'Cause you're here 
You're going out the world backwards
Like you did when you first came here 

Keep talking about the president 
Won't stop air pollution 
Put your hand over your mouth 
When you cough 
That'll help the solution 

You cuss around women folk 
You don't even know their name 
Then you're dumb enough to think 
That it makes you a big ol' man

Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
If you don't respect yourself 
Ain't nobody gonna give a good 
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh 
Respect yourself 

Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
If you dont respect yourself 
Aint nobody gonna give a good 
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh 
Respect yourself
