Watch out!

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want, don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
Too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(Watch out, watch out, watch out)
(Fade...)
