We were waltzin' together to a dreamy melody 
When they called out "Change partners" 
And you waltzed away from me 
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor 
And I'll keep on changing partners 
Till I hold you once more 

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part 
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart 
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then 
Oh, my darlin' I will never change partners again 

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part 
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart 
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then 
Oh, my darlin' I will never change partners again
