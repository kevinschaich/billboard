Papa loves mambo 
Mama loves mambo 
Look at 'em sway with it, gettin' so gay with it 
Shoutin' "olé" with it, wow! (ooh!) 

Papa loves mambo

Mama loves mambo

Papa does great with it, swings like a gate with it 
He loses weight with it, now! 

He goes to, she goes fro 
He goes fast, she goes slow 
He goes left 'n' she goes right 
(Papa's lookin' for mama but mama is nowhere in sight) 

Papa loves mambo 
Mama loves mambo 
Havin' their fling again, younger than Spring again 
Feelin' that zing again, wow! (ooh!) 

Papa loves mambo

Don't let her rumba and don't let her samba 
'cause papa loves mama tonight (ooh!)
