Here, in this enchanted place
Here, enclosed in your embrace
Here with you so near to me
Here is where I want to be

The world outside may be thrilled by
The treasures that people buy for gold
But I would rather be thrilled by
The treasures that I alone can hold

Here, beside the warmth of you
Here, within a dream for two
Here, for all eternity
Here is where I want to be

 2.01

Here, beside the warmth of you
Here, within a dream for two
Here, for all eternity
Here is where I want to be
