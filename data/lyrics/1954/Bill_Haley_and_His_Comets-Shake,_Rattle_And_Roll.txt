Get out from that kitchen, 
And rattle those pots and pans,
Well, roll my breakfast, 
Cause I'm a hungry man.

I said, shake, rattle, and roll,
Well, you'll never do nothing, 
To save your doggone soul.

Wearing those dresses, 
Your hair done up so nice,
You look so warm, 
But your heart is cold as ice.

I'm like a one-eyed cat, 
Peeping in a sea food store,
I can look at you, 
'Til you don't love me no more.

I believe you're doing me wrong, 
And now I know,
The more I work, 
The faster my money goes.

I said, shake, rattle, and roll,
Well, you'll never do nothing, 
To save your doggone soul.
