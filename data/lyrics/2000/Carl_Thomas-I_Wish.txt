(Verse 1)
It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

(Chorus)
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

(Verse 2)
It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

(Chorus)
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

(Bridge)
Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Even you win
Someone has to lose

(Chorus (with some adlibbing))
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

(Chorus (with some adlibbing))
Ohh met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
She still belongs to someone else
Wish I never, wish I never
