Everybody wants an easy ride,
On the merry-go-round that we call life.
Take a drive on cruise control,
Then you wait to find it's a winding road.
I had my dreams in view,
When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky.

And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down.

Well, oh, that's the way it is!
You gotta roll with the punches.
That's the way it goes!
You gotta bend when the wind blows.
You live you learn,
You crash and burn.
It's hit or miss. (That's the way)
And that's the way it is.

One fine day you wake up,
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love.
He's just what you're lookin' for,
The only problem is, that the man's not sure.
Another guy'll give you everything,
The only problem is you don't feel a thing.
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.
Oh, one day you get what you want.
But it's not what you think.
Then you get what you need.

Well, oh, that's the way it is!
You gotta roll with the punches.
That's the way it goes!
You gotta bend when the wind blows.
You live you learn,
You crash and burn.
It's hit or miss. (That's the way)
And that's the way it is.

Yeah they say your soul is growin' but,
Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'.

And that's the way it is.
You gotta roll with the punches.
And that's the way it goes.
You gotta bend when the wind blows.
That's the way it is.
You gotta roll with the punches.
That's the way it goes.
You gotta bend when the wind blows.
You live you learn,
You crash and burn,
It's hit or miss, Oh
And that's the way it is.


Oh that's the way it is. Yeah.
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is.
You gotta roll with the punches.
Oh. You gotta bend when the wind blows.
Oh. That's the way it goes.
That's the way it is.
That's the way it goes. Oh, yeah.
You gotta roll with the punches.
