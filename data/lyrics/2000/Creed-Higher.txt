When dreaming
I'm guided to another world
Time and time again

At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave
The comfort of this place

'Cause there's a hunger
A-longing to escape
From the life I live, when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams

But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make
The earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is
To let love replace
All our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

So let's go there
Let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Up high, I feel like I'm
Alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
