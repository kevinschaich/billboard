When I'm looking at you, I keep thinking
Why can't she be like you?
So I'm scheming
I can't go on like this, believing
that her love is true
(Oh no)
Standing on the dance floor, while she's trickin'
You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together but love is missing
Girl I want you
So what can we do?
(Tell me baby yeah)

Girl, if it's all right
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonite
I've got a girl but you look good tonite
It's one on one tonite
Tonite
Girl, if it's all right
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonite
You shouldn't have to be alone tonite
It's one on one tonite
Tonite

Now she's looking at me, but keep talking
Oh now she's trying to ice you
Let's start walking
Over on the dance floor
It's her fault but,
what can she do?
Tell me baby

MJ - If you're ready
Girls - I'm ready
MJ - We can get it on
Girls - We can get it on
MJ - I know where I went wrong
Girls - She's where you went wrong
MJ - With you is where I belong

Girl, if I could find the words to say
I've gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you

Girl, if it's all right
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonite
I've got a girl but you look good tonite
It's one on one tonite
Tonite
Girl, if it's all right
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonite
You shouldn't have to be alone tonite
It's one on one tonite
Tonite
