I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I couldn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrender just to hear your voice
I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something baby that you need to know
That deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Chorus
Baby, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Livin' with out you, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

I wish i can tell you that i'm feeling better everyday 
that I didn't hurt when you walked away 
but to tell you the truth I can't fine my way 
That deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Baby, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Livin' with out you, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

Baby, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Livin' with out you, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

Baby, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Livin' with out you, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I couldn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrender just to hear your voice
