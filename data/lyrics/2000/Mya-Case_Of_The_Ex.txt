Yeah Mýa 
Red Zone wha-what 

It's after midnight 
And she's on your phone 
Saying come over 
'Cause she's all alone 
I could tell it was your ex 
By your tone 
Why is she calling now 
After so long 

Now what is that she wants
Tell me what is that she needs
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

Whatcha gonna do
When you can't say no
When her feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know
And how you gonna act
How you gonna handle that
Whatcha gonna do when she wants you back

Whatcha gonna do
When you can't say no
When her feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know
And how you gonna act
How you gonna handle that
Whatcha gonna do when she wants you back

There's no need to
Reminisce about the past
Obviously 'cause that shit did not last
I know how a woman will try to game you
So don't get caught up
Because baby you'll lose

Now what is that she wants
Tell me what is that she needs
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't shared no mutual friends

When y'all broke up in '96

In the middle of the night
Tell me why she in your life
Trying to get what's mine
She don't know me
She's about to know me
I'm in your life
That's how its gonna be
I've seen her photo
She ain't even all that
So if you want her back
You can take her back
'Cause game recognize game
I could do the same thing
Get it right change
Or take back this ring
