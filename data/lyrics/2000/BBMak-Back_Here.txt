Baby set me free
From this misery
I can't take it no more
Since you ran away,
Nothing's been the same
Don't know what I'm livin for

Here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do

Until you're back here baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside,
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't let you go

So I told you lies,
Even made you cry
Baby I was so wrong.
Girl I promise you, 
Now my love is true
This is where my heart belongs

'Cause here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do

Until you're back here baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside,
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't let you go

And I wonder...
Are you thinkin' of me?
'Cause I'm thinkin' of you.

And I wonder...
Are you ever comin' back in my life?

'Cause here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do...

Until you're back here baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby yeah
There's a feelin' inside,
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't...

Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)

There's a feelin' inside,
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't...

Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
Until you're back here baby
(Until you're back here baby)
