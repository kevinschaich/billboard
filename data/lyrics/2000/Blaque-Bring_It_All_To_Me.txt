There you are
Lookin' as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you lookin' at me

What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind baby, oh

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if I told you how I feel?
That's just the way
I do my thing

I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timbs, my baggy jeans
My thug appeal
Do you like it when a man can keep it real

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good you make me feel inside
There's not a single question that we can't make this right
'Cause it's you I need every day and night, oh, baby, yeah

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy
