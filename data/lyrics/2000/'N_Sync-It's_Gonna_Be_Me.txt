It's gonna be me
Oooh, yeah

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh oh

I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste

You're just too blind (too blind) to see
But in the end you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody (somebody)
Guess what (guess what)
It's gonna be me

It's gonna be me
Ooh, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna
It's gonna be me

All that I do
Is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like that

When finally (finally)
You get to love
Guess what (guess what)

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you (for you, baby)
You don't wanna lose it again (don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody (love)
Guess what (guess what)
It's gonna be me

Every little thing I do (oh oh)
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again (don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what (guess what)
It's gonna be me
