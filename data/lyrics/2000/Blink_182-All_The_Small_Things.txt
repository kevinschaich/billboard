All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip

Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

Nanana...

Late night
Come home
Work sucks
I know

She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

Nanana...

Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

Keep your head still
I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
My little windmill

Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

Keep your head still
I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill
