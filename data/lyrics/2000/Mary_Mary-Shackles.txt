Spoken:
Whew, it sure is hot out here, you know.
I don't mind, though.
I'm glad to be free, you know what I'm saying?
Uh,

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
What you wanna do?  - spoken
I just wanna praise You
Yeah, yeah - spoken
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Fill me - spoken
And I'm gonna praise You
What you gonna do? - spoken
I'm gonna praise you

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been bound for so long
Felt like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands
I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
See so much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gonna lose my mind
Lord I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
Cause I can't take it no more

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
So I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Oh yeah
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

Yeah
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
I wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
Lord, I just want to
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Take em off, take em off
What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Lift off the chains
What you gonna do?
