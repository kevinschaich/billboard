Intro


See first of all, I know these so called players wouldn't tell you this
But, Ima be real and say what's on my heart
Lets take this chance to make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start yeah eah eah yeeah

Then I think about, all the years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this faar
Then I think about,where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing youu. uh oh

Chorus:
Meet me at the alter in your white dress
We ain't get no younger we might as well do 
Been feelin' you all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married

Meet me at the alter in your white dress
We ain't gettin no younger (so) we might as well do it
Been feelin' you all the while girl and I must confess
Lets get married

Said I done it all, but frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause making love to just anyone ain't happinin'
I just gotta be with you.ooh osh
Did you think about, us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my aauhall (all)
Did you think about maybe us havin some babies
Come on wont you be my lady
Forever girllllllllllll

Im ready to, commit to you
And i just cant wait for that night
Cause I need you here with me and lets start a family

Chorus. (11x)
