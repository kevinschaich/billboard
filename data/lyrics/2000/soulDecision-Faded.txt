When I get you all alone
I’m gonna take off all your clothes
Ain’t nobody gonna interrupt my game, oh no, no
Ever since you’ve been hanging around
I’ve been trying to figure out
What I can say to you to get some play, yeah

Couldn’t we do what we did last night again?
Baby you and I’d be better than friends
Don’t you think it’s time we went a bit further, oh yeah?
Every night when we say goodbye
How can I help looking in your eyes?
Wondering why you and I haven’t hit it
Can we get it on?

I’m kinda faded but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I can’t pretend that you’re only my friend
When you’re holding my body tight
‘Cause I like the way you’re making it move
I like the way you’re making me wait
At the end of the night when I make up your mind
You’ll be coming on home with me

Yeah, you know you got it
And you know I want it
I can’t wait to take you home
(You know you got it and I...)
I don’t want to be rude at all
I just want to be where you go
Think what we could do alone
(Yeah)

Rap (Thrust)
Uhh Uhh
When we first met, yo that deal was stated
You stepped like my steez the way we conversated
Just another day
Around the way
With me up close
With everything ok
‘Cause I'm not like the rest
Indecision with best
Thrust with my full court press
Just because they hate it
How's it go
Hi, yo, I'm faded

I’m kinda faded but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I can’t pretend that you’re only my friend
When you’re holding my body tight
‘Cause I like the way you’re making it move
I like the way you’re making me wait

You’ll be coming on home with me...(repeats)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
