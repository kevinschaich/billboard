Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why
And I don't know
