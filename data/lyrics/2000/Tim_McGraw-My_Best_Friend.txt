I never had no one that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend
You're my best friend
