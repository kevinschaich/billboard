I was always the crazy one
Who broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number
On the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one
And a valedictorian
So under your number I wrote
Call for a good time
I only wanted to get your attention
But you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby with your wake up call

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

Tell me baby!
I will preach on! Haha
