(verse one)
I just left my baby girl a message, said I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time

I could be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her
But I need some time to be alone

(chorus)
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how, I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

(verse two)
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you

(chorus)
