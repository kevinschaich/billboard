She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Oh, and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, can I see you again

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night, looking in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since she said yes
I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
She said yes
