Girl I wish that I could spend time with you 
Each and everyday.


Playing on my love emotions 
That's the thing that's got me open
And I don't know what it takes to let you know 
You're my girl, to let you know you're my baby


And even when they say we won't stay around


If they only knew that we were meant to be together 
Forever and ever whatever there's no better than me 
and you girl that's why I write you love letters 
saying... 


Chorus
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it 


Sometimes I wanna be the one you be checking for 
Can I get a second for.


Me and you to be alone tell me if you think it's wrong
Love is nothing but the time it takes to say I'm on your mind
Let me tell you, I'm always there oh yea


Let's get a little time a way go to the movies on a Saturday


Meet me at the finish line
So I can tell you one more time
Girl you know I'm not scared to let you see that


Chorus
I like the way you look at me


I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it.
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby.
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it 


When I think of you 
I think of all the things we could do
And I never wanna let you go
And as long as I can let you know
I hope we stay down forever. 


I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it. 


Chorus
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it 


I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it.
