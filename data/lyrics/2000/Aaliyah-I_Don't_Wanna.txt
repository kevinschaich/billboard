I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

When we hooked up
We sat down
Made an agreement
We vowed that
That we'd always be together
Through whatever
We said that no one would ever
Get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was a while ago, oh
But now lately
It feels like
I mean I feel like
All we do is fight
Every single night
Can't make it tight
Can't get it right
I just wanna go back
Take it way back
All the way back
Can we start again?
do it over
Can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?
'Cause...

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

Do you realize
I can't sleep without you
Think without you
Eat without you
Speak without you
Be without you
I can't even breathe without you
I can't feel without you
Deal without you
Spend without you
My whole world is upside down
Don't wanna go out
'Cause I can't ride without you
Feel like I'm 'gon die without you
What is a girl supposed to do
When I spend my last dime to be in your life?
I don't wanna be without you

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

How can this be
That it's not working out?
We vowed to be
Always together
It's hurting me
That we don't talk no more
It wasn't supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong?
We both made mistakes
We gotta carry on

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be
(be without you, be without you)
I don't wanna live
(live without you, live without you)
I don't wanna go
(go without you, go without you)
I don't wanna be alone
