It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

What would you do to get to me?
What would say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again
If I hesitate to let you in?

Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off or would you stay, oh

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

I went to you, you went to me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not till I see where this could be
Could be eternity or just a week

You know our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thang and we'll see how it goes, oh

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first day, what about the next day?
Ah, ah, ah, ah

See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be buggin' on the first day but what about the next day?
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again (yeah yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

New millenium baby
