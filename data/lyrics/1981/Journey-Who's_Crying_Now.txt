It's been a mystery 
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad

Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways

And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fightin' is worth the love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

Only so many tears you can cry
'Til the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now
