Oooh, short and sweet
No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on
If the fire's out we should both be gone

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us?

Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Can we?

Now don't you get me wrong (What you sayin' to me, baby?)
'Cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all (Let's start something new)
It's just that I have seen (What have you seen?)
Too many lovers' hearts lose their dreams (We won't lose it)

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us?

Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Can we?

How 'bout us, how 'bout us, baby?
How 'bout us, how about us, baby?
How 'bout us, how 'bout us, baby?

Are we gonna make it, girl?
Or are we gonna drift and drift and drift together?

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us? (How 'bout us, baby?)

Some people can hold it together
How 'bout us
Some people

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
(Some people can love one another for life)
How 'bout us? (How 'bout us, baby?)

Some people can hold it together
How 'bout us?

How 'bout us, baby?

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us? (You and me, baby)

Some people can hold it together (Hold it together)
Can we?
Say that we can make it, baby

Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us?
