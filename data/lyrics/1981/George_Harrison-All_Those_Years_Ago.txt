I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
And you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

Talking all 'bout how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
"All you need is love"

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

All those years ago
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago

You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

Ooh, all those years ago
Ooh, all those years ago
Ooh, all those years ago
All those years ago
