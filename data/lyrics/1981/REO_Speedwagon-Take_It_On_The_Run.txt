Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
They say you got a boyfriend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down 

But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheaper when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is, keep this in mind 

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run 

You're thinking up your white lies
You're putting on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home, but you won't say when
But I can feel it coming
If you leave tonight, keep running
And you need never look back again 

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
