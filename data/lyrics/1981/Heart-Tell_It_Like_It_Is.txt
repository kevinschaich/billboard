If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby I will, girl you know I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But ooh now deep down inside me, i believe you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Tell it like it is
Have nothing to play with go find yourself a toy
But ooh, deep down deep inside me I belive you love me
Forget your foolish pride

If you are serious 
Don't play, don't play  with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you then baby i will, you know i will

Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy anymore

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed let you conscience be your guide
