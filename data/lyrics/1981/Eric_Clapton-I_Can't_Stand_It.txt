You've been told
So maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold
Maybe it's time that you earned

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I won't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

I'll explain
I feel like I'm being used
Make it plain
So you don't get confused

I can't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
Fooling around with my heart

I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're playing around with my heart

It's time
Time for me to let you know
Ain't no crime
No crime to let your feelings show

I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it

You're running around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
Fooling around, I can't stand it
Running around, I can't stand it

Running around, I won't stand it
Running around, I won't stand it
You're fooling around, I won't stand it

You're fooling around with my heart
You're fooling around with my heart
My heart
Running around
Fooling around with my heart

Fooling around, I won't stand it
Running around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Running around, I can't stand it
Fooling around, I can't stand it

Running around
Running around
Running around
Running around
Running around
Run, run, run, runing
