I wake up every mornin'
I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin'
Another day ahead
It seems to last forever
And time goes slowly by
'Til babe and me's together
Then it starts to fly

'Cos the moment that he's with me
Time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me
Everything's alright
Night time is the right time
We make love
Then it's his and my time
We take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie
Or to a restaurant, to go
Slow dancing
Anything I want
Only when he's with me
I catch a light
Only when he gives me
Makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him
Dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him
And he's crazy mad for me
(Crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train
I'm makin' a fool, a fight
Work all day to earn his pay
So we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine till five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him
(My baby takes the morning train)
