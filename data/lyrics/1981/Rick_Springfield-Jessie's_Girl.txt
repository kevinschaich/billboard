Jessie is a friend,
Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman...
Why can't I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?
Tell me why can't I find a woman like that?

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl
