Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on 
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day 
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye

Ooh, ooh

Pulses racing, darling
Out where we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark

It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to out in the cold
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're building on

You got be mine
We take it away
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky

I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your

And we got nothing
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end (Oh, we never)
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky (We got a highway)
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
