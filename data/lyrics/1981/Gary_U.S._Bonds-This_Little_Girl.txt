Here she comes walkin' down the stree-eet
You know she's walkin' just like she's walkin' to come and see me-ee
Oh she's so you-ou-ou-oung and she's so fi-ine
I know what's on your mind, know what you wanna do
But if you mess with her, I'm gonna mess with you
You better watch your step, You better stay in line

This little girl is mi-i-ine, Oh-oh this little girl is mi-i-ine
Oh-oh this little girl, this little girl, this little gir-irl is mi-ine
Oh-oh this little girl is mi-i-ine, Oh-oh this little girl is mi-ine
Oh-oh this little girl, this little girl, this little gir-irl is mi-ine

Well if the world was mine to do with what I want to do sir
Well I'd wrap it up in a bow and give it all to her-er, yeah
And all my lo-ove, all of the ti-i-ime
You know I'd hold her tight, I'd never let her go
And late at night, You know I'd love her so
Yeah, I'd treat her right, So she'd never mind

But this little girl is mi-ine, Oh-oh this little girl is mi-i-ine
Oh-oh this little girl, this little girl, This little girl is mi-mi-mi-mine

Hey you better watch out, I'm tellin' you the score-ore
Are you gonna be sweepin' your broken heart up off the floor-oor
Oh and that ain't a-all, I'm tellin' you my frie-iend
I know what's on your mind, know what you wanna do
But if you mess with her, I'm gonna mess with you
You like the way she moves, you like to watch her walk
You better listen up 'cause man this ain't just talk
You better watch yourself, you better stay in line

Now mister I said
This little girl is mi-ine, Oh-oh this little girl is mi-i-ine
This little girl, this little girl, this little girl is mi-i-ine
Oh-oh this little girl, this little girl
