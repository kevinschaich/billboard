I, I love the colorful clothes she wears 
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair 
I hear the sound of a gentle word 
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good good good good vibrations 
(Oom bop bop) 
She's giving me excitations 
(Oom bop bop excitations) 
Good good good good vibrations

We always take my car cause it's never been beat 
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet 
None of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right 
To leave their best girl home now on Saturday night 
I get around 
Get around round round I get around 
From town to town 
Get around round round I get around 
I'm a real cool head 
Get around round round I get around 
I'm makin' real good bread 
Get around round round I get around 
I get around 
Round 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
Round round get around

Ahh ooo ooo 

It happened on the strip where the road is wide 
(Oooo rev it up now) 
Two cool shorts standin' side by side 
(Oooo rev it up now) 

Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen 
(Oooo rev it up now) 
Revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean 
(Oooo rev it up now) 
Tach it up, tach it up 
Buddy gonna shut you down 

Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari) 
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari)with me 
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari) 
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari)with me

Bar bar bar bar Barbar Ann

You got me rockin' and a rollin' 
Rockin' and a reelin' Barbara Ann 
Bar bar bar bar Barbar Ann 
Let's go now 

If everybody had an ocean 
Across the U.S.A. 
Then everybody'd be surfin' 
Like Californi-a 
You'd seem 'em wearing their baggies 
Huarachi sandals too 
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo 
Surfin' U.S.A. 

Well she got her daddy's car 
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now 
Seems she forgot all about the library 
Like she told her old man now 
And with the radio blasting 
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now 
And she'll have fun fun fun 
'Til her daddy took the T-Bird away 
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away) 
Ooo-wee ooo-weeoo 
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away) 
Ooo-wee ooo-weeoo 
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away) 

(Repeat and fade)
