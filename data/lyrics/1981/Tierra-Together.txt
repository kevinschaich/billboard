Oh, we could be on a desert
Lost without a place to go
But we are so in love
In love with each other

(Oh-oh, I) I don't care (I don't care)
Any place anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long) just as long
(We are there) as we are there
 
Baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just)
Baby, just you and me, yeah

With no one to lean a helping hand
But it's alright, (alright)
Alright I know
Because you always understand
(Oh-oh, I) I don't care (I don't care)
Any place anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long) just as long
(We can share) as we share
 
Baby, baby

Baby, just you and me, yeah
