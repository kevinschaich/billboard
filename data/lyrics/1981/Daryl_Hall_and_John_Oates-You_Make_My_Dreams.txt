What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how, I can't explain

Oh yeah, well, well you
You make my dreams come true
Well, well, well you
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true
Well yeah

On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same

Oh yeah, well, 'cause you
You make my dreams come true
Oh yeah, well, well, well you
You make my dreams come true
Oh yeah

Well, listen to this...

I'm down on my daydream
Oh that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know, well you
Yeah, you make my dreams come true
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl!
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true
Me, you, me, you, me
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl
Oh my, you make my dreams come true
I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for...
You make my dreams
I've been waiting for you girl
You make my dreams
