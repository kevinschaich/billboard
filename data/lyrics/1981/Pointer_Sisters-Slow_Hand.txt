As the midnight moon was drifting through 
The lazy sway of the trees 
I saw the look in your eyes looking into mine 
Seeing what you wanted to see 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind 

I want a man with a slow hand 
I want a lover with an easy touch 
I want somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground with no one around 
And a blanket of stars in our eyes 
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves 
On the crazy wind of the night 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
If I want it all night, you say it's alright 
We got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 

If I want it all night,
Please say it's alright 
It's not a fast move but a slow groove 
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
I've found a lover with a slow hand

Ooh, lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush

Ooh, lover with a slow hand
