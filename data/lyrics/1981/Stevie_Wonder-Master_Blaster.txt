Everyone's feelin' pretty
Its hotter than July
Tho' the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us
Even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonite there'll be a party
On the corner, at the end of the block

(chorus)
Didnt know you
Would be jammin it
'Til  the break of dawn
See  nobody ever told me
That you would be jammin' it
'Til the break of dawn
We'll be jammin' it,
Jammin' it, jammin' it
Jam  on

They want us to join the fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze, through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the One
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

(chorus)
*add  refrain;
We're in the middle
of the making of the master blaster, jammin

You ask me; "Am I happy?"
Well, as matter of fact,
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we've all just made a pact

We've agreed to get together
And join as children in JAH
When you're movin' in the positve
Your destination is the brightest star

chorus

I bet you if someone approached you yesterday
to tell you that you would be jammin'
you would not believe it
cause you never thougt that you would be jammin'
