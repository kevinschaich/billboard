Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Mmm-mmm-mmm

A woman needs a love just like you do, hoo
Don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

Don't the mistake of thinkin' old fashioned 
Times have changed from yesterday
But no longer will those old double standards 
Be accepted by the women of today

So when you think you're foolin' her
She just might be foolin' you
Remember if you can do it
She can too

Because a woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

When her eyes are beggin' for affection 
Don't put her off, don't make her wait
Don't try to give her that worn out excuse 
About being tired and workin' late

I tell you one day you'll come home early from work 
Open up the door and get your feelings hurt

Because she needs it, yeah 
A woman's got to have it, whoa, yeah, just like you
And if you're smart, mmm,  you better stop foolin' around, hey, hey
'Cause she will too, oh

Just like you do, hoo
Thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh
Just like you, hoo
Now an example to you

Is by the time poor Jack
Returned up the hill
Somebody else
Had been lovin' Jill

A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around , she will fool around so
You better take out some insurance and be sure she won't

Give her the love, mmm , yeah
That sweet, sweet love, she wants it just like you
'Cause she can fool around just like she will fool around
With you or without you, just like you do

A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh
She can fool around just like you, hoo
A woman needs it just like you
