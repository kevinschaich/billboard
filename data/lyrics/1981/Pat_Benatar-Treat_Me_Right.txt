You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
I'm nearing the end

One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't wanna be no martyr
You know what to stay
Oh mama baby before it's too late

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light

So you think I'm a fool
Well you better think twice
I've had enough baby
It's time to realize
You can't have both ways
It's no way to live
You've done all the taking
It's your turn to give.

One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't wanna be no martyr
You know what to stay
Oh mama baby before it's too late

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light

Oh, treat me right

You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
I'm nearing the end

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light

Oh treat me right
Treat me right...
