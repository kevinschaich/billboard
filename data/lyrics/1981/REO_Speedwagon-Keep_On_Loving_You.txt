You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen

You played dead
Ah, but you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before then
And we're still together

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you

Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you
