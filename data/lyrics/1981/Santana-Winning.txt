One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and 
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head 
Lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around 
Fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door

Chorus: 
I'm winning 
I'm winning
I'm winning 
And I don't intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And not meant to be
It took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day 
That I breathe for
Friends agree there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

Chorus: 
(repeat first line 5x) 
(repeat last line 4x) 

Repeat Verse II
