Time, flowing like a river
Time, beckoning me
Who knows when we shall meet again
If ever 
But time
Keeps flowing like a river
To the sea

Goodbye my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my love
The tide waits for me
Who knows when we shall meet again
If ever 
But time
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)
To the sea, to the sea

Till it's gone forever 
Gone forever
Gone forevermore

Goodbye my friends (Goodbye my love)
Maybe forever 
Goodbye my friends (Who knows where we shall meet)
The stars wait for me
Who knows where we shall meet again
If ever 
But time
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)
To the sea, to the sea

Till it's gone forever 
Gone forever
Gone forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
