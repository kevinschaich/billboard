My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I, I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever (ooh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love (oh, love)
I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

Because you
You mean the world to me, oh
I know, I know
I've found in you
My endless love

Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, booom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Ooh, and love, oh, love
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know I don't mind

And, yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside

And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love
