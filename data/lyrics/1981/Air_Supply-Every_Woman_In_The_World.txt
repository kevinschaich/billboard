Overnight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me oh oh oh

It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and  lights
but you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing  in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me oh oh oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'll stay right here forever oh oh oh

Chorus
