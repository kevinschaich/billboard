I'm coming out (I'm comin')
I'm coming out
I'm coming out
I'm coming out
I'm coming out
I'm coming out

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

There's a new me coming out
And I just had to live
And I wanna give
I'm completely positive
I think this time around
I am gonna do it
Like you never knew it
Ooh, I'll make it through

The time has come for me
To break out of the shell
I have to shout
That I am coming out

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I'm coming out (comin)
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm comin
I'm coming out (comin)
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I've got to show the world
All that I wanna be
And all my abilities
There's so much more to me
Somehow, I'll have to make them
Just understand
I got it well in hand
And, oh, how I have planned
I'm spreadin' love
There's no need to fear
And I just feel so glad
Everytime I hear:

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out (comin)
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm comin
I'm comin
I'm comin

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out (I'm comin)
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out (I'm comin)
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I'm, I'm comin' OUT!
I have to shout 
That I'm comin out
I have to work it out
I have to let it out
