Its now or never; Come hold me tight.
Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight.
Tomorrow will be too late.
Its now or never; My love wont wait.
When I first saw you with your smile so tender,
My heart was captured; My soul surrendered.
I've spent a life time waiting for the right time.
Now that you're near the time is here at last.
It's now or never; Come hold me tight.
Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight.
Tomorrow will be too late.
It's now or never; My love won't wait.
Just like a willow we could cry an ocean,
If we lost true love and sweet devotion,
your lips excite me; Let your arms invite me.
For who knows when we'll meet again this way.
It's now or never; Come hold me tight.
Kiss me, my darling; be mine tonight.
Tomorrow will be too late.
It's now or never; My love won't wait.
