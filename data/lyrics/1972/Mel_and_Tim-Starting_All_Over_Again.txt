Starting all over again is gonna be rough, so rough
But we're gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be rough, on us
But we gotta face it

We lost what we had, that's why it hurt so bad
It set us back a thousand years
We're gonna make it up, though it's gonna be rough
To erase all the hurt and tears

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
But we both know that we can make it

We gotta take life as it comes
And never worry about who's right or wrong
It's an uphill climb to the finish line
We're gonna try to make it one more time

Starting all over again is gonna be rough, so rough
But we're gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be tough, on us
But we gotta face it

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
We both know that we're gonna make it
