He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
They started going steady and bless my soul 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
