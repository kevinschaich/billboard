Precious and few are the moments we two can share
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'm hung over you
And if I can't find my way back home
It just wouldn't be fair
Precious and few are the moments we two can share 

Baby, it's you on my mind, your love is so rare 
Being with you is a feeling I just can't compare 
And if I can't hold you in my arms 
It just wouldn't be fair
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share

And if I can't find my way back home 
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair 
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share 

Precious and few are the moments we two can share 
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'm hung over you
And if I can't find my way back home
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair 
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share
