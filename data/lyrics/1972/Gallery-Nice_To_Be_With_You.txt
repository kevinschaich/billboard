Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things you say and do
And it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way
Honey, I got the notion
You're causing commotion in my soul

Baby, you and me
Have got something that's real
I know it's gonna last a lifetime
Aww, you better believe it, girl

At night, I call your name
Darkness fills my room
I'm only dreaming about
The time I`m gonna be with you

Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things you say and do
And it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way
Honey, I got the notion
You're causing commotion in my soul

When I'm feeling down
You're there to pick me up
And help me to carry on
Aww, little things mean a lot

When you need a shoulder to cry on
I'm there to ease the pain
And chase away the rain
Aww darling, I just gotta say

Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things you say and do
And it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way

Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things you say and do
And it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way
