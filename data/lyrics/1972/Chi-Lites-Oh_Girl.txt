Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how

Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh

Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh, yeah yeah

Don't know where to go, who to see, yeah

Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl, I've gotta get away from here

Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how

Oh, yeah
Oh, girl
Why do I love you so?
Yeah

Better be on my way, I can't stay
Have you ever seen such a helpless man, oh no
Oh girl
