And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so

And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

I cry each night my tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again (you'll be back in my arms once again)

Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love

Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love

(This is not a puppy love)
(This is not a puppy love)
Not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
(This is not a puppy love)
