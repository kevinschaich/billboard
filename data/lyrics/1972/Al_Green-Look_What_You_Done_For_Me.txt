Now that you're here with me, 
I want to keep you free, 
to do the things that you want to do, 
the joy in life is loving you, 
but now the day has come, 
to let you know where I'm coming from, 
the best of my years will go to you, 
it's the only thing that I can do, 
but these things don't come overnight, 
lovin' you baby, I think I'm right. 
Let me say before I forget, 
lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
oh but I feel, ya... 
Sometimes I wanna leave, but then I say, 
it wouldn't make sense at all, 


anyway, forgive me baby, 
if I do wrong, 
I haven't been a true man for so long, 
let be say before I forget, 
lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
baby, do you wanna, do the thing that you oughta, 
you've been very good for me, 
and that's a fact, I say, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
oh, no matter, baby... 
what you done for me... 
I got the feelin' that it's gonna... 
ya, look what you done for me...
