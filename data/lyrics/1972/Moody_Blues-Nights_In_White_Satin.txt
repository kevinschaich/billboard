Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you

Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be you will be in the end

And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
