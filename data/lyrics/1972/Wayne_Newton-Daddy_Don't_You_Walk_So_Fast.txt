The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway when I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

Now, it broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run to catch a train
She had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good
I turned around and there she was again
As she said to me

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

If only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again
She cried and said

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Oh, daddy, don't you walk so fast

(Daddy, don't you walk so fast)
My daughter cried (Daddy, don't you walk so fast)
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
