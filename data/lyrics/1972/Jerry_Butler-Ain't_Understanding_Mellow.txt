JERRY'S PART

Ohhhhhhhhhhh
I thank God for you
(I thank God, I thank God)
You were woman enough, girl not to try to hide
(Didn't try to hide it baby- repeat 2 time)
Didn't try to hide your love
For this other guy, hey
No need to explain

Ohhhhhhhhh
I thank the angles for you
That you were woman enough try to make it easier for me
(Try to make it easy,-repeat 3 times)
Where ever, say it, where ever you go
I want you to know, you have but to call on me
And I'll be right by your side

THE WOMANS PART
