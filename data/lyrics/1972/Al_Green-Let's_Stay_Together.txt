(Let's stay together)

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say, since (baby)
Since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Ooh baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break up
And turn around and make up
I just can't deceive
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Staying being around you is all I see

Here's what I want us to do
Let's, we ought to stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Come on, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad
