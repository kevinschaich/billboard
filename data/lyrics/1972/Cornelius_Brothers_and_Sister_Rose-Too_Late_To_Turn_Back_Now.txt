My mama told me
She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

She told me, it can break your heart
And put you in misery
Since I met this little woman
I feel it's happened to me
And I'm telling you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

I found myself phoning her
At least ten times a day
You know, it's so unusual for me
To carry on this way

I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night
Wanting to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feeling just can't be right
And I'm telling you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now, baby
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late, baby (to turn back now)
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

I wouldn't mind it if I knew
She really loved me too
But I hate to think
That I'm in love alone
And nothing that I can do, whoa

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
