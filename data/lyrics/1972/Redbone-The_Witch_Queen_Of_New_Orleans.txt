Marie, Marie 
La voodoo, veau 
She'll put a spell on you 
Marie, Marie 
La voodoo, veau 
She's the witch queen - oh 
Of New Orleans 

Of New Orleans 

I'm gonna tell you a story 
Strange as it now seems 
Of zombie, voodoo, gris gris 
And the Witch Queen of New Orleans 

She lived in a world of magic 
Possessed by the devils skew 
From a shack near the swamplands 
Made of mud-brown brick 
Marie stirred the witches brew 

Marie, Marie 
La voodoo veau 
She'll put a spell on you

Marie, Marie 
La voodoo veau 
She'll put a spell on you

Marie Marie 
La voodoo veau 
She's the Witch Queen - of New Orleans 

Of New Orleans 

Dime or a nickel anyone could buy 
Voodoo of any kind 
She had potions and lotions, herbs 
And tanna leaves 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 

Early one morning into mud, the swamp dew 
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes 
Though she never returned 
All the Cajuns knew 
A Witch Queen never dies. 

Marie, Marie 
La voodoo, veau 
She'll put a spell on you 

Marie, Marie 
La voodoo, veau 
She'll put a spell on you 

Marie, Marie 
La voodoo, veau 
She's the witch queen - oh 
Of New Orleans
