You say
I only hear what I want to
You say
I talk so all the time
So

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leavin'
Now I know that I did somethin' wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah I missed you

And you say
I only hear what I want to, I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're runnin'
To anyone, anywhere, I
Don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative 
No, no, no (bad)

So I, I turn the radio on, I turn the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song
Lovers in love and the others run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover while we're waiting for the other who was dyin' since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that, think that I'm throwin' but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
That won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere 
With you

You said that I was naive, and (naive...)
I thought that I was strong, oh
I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave", oh (leave...)
But now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you
Yeah... I miss you

You said, "You caught me 'cause you want me" and one day you let me go
You try to keep away a keeper or keep me 'cause you know you're just so 
Scared to lose

And you say
"Stay"

You say
I only hear what I want to
