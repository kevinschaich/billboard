My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
Oh yeah

My first love (yeah)
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

(Oh) 
And I (And I)
I want to share
All my love with you, hey yeah
No one else will do 
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You will always be
My endless love
Oh yeah

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever (forever)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
No no no no (no no no)

And I
(And I)
I'd be a fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind (no, you know I don't mind)
'Cause baby you (baby, baby, baby, baby)
You mean the world to me, yeah
I know I've found in you
My endless love

Yeah (yeah)
Do do, do dooo, do do do

Whoa
And I
I'd play the fool 
For you, (for you baby) I'm sure
That you know I don't mind (you know I don't mind)
Oh, yes
You'd be the only one
'Cause no-one can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love (my love, my love)
My my my
My endless love

Mmm
My love
