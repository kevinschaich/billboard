Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our beds until the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle turns and burns
Without you, oh I cannot live
Forgive the yearning, burning
I believe it's time to heal, to feel
So take me now
Take me now
Take me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
And if anybody says this, it belongs to us
