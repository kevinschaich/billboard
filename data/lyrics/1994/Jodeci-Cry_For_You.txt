Without you baby
I feel worthless
I'm livin on the edge

It's been an hour
since you've been gone
and that's too long
so come back home
I can't live without you
so I'll cry for you

do anything that I can
to feel that touch from your hand
sorry that I want you
lady what do I do

bridge:

you know you're everything I do
ooh yeah
do what you want me to
I would do anything
get on my knees for you
ooooh, baby
what else is there to do
I don't know, I don't know
but I'll cry

chorus:

lady I, will cry for you tonight

like a child
when you're not here I can't even smile
I can't think without you
my mind is always with you
it's amazing what you do
to keep me falling in love with you
girl you all that I know
where else can I go

I say you're everything I do
ooh wee
do what you want me to
anything you need from me baby
get on my knees for you
ohhh, ooooh, ohh

I don't know, I don't know
but I'll cry
