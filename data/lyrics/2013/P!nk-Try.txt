Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin'
How it all turned to lies
Sometimes I think, that it's better
To never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry
When you're out there
Doin' what you're doin'
Are you just getting by
Tell me, are you just getting by by by

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
