Mac Miller:
What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.

Ariana Grande:
I love the way you make me feel;
I love it, I love it...
I love the way you make me feel;
I love it, I love it...

Mac:
Say... I’m thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,
Do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
"Do she love me, do she love me not?" (Love me not...)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot... 

Ariana:
You give me that kind of something,
Want it all the time, need it every day...
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred;
Never get enough, I can’t stay away...

If you want it, I got it, I got it every day;
You can get whatever you need from me...
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you,
And I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper

So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...

I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...

I love the way (you make me feel,)
I love the way... (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...

Ooh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin',
When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it's ain’t a question (q-question,)
'Cause boy, I know just what you like...

So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day;
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me...
Stay by your side! (I’ll never leave you...)
Said I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you’re a keeper...

So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...

I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...

I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)
I love the way... (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...

Mac:
Uh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine;
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind...
You’re a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time;
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you’re sleeping in mine,
Come and watch a movie with me - “American Beauty” 
Or “Bruce Almighty” that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...
I got some feelings for you I’m not gonna get bored of,
But baby, you an adventure, so let me come and explore you...

Ariana:
So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...

I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...

I love the way...  (I love the way you make me feel,) 
I love the way...  (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way...  (I love the way you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way! (I love it, I love it...)

I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)
I love the way... (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...

The way I love you...
You, you, yeah, the way...

I love the way you make me feel,
I love it, I love it...
I love the way you make me feel,
I love it - the way I love you...
