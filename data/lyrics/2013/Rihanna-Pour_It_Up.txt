Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Strip club and dollar bills
I still got my money
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
I still got my money

Strippers goin' up and down that pole
And I still got my money
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
'Cause I still got my money

Money make the world go round
I still got my money
Bands make your girl go down
I still got my money

Lot more where that came from
I still got my money
The look in yo eyes I know you want some
I still got my money

Ohhhh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out

Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out

Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bill
I still got my money
Go lollop in my grill
I still got my money

Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got my money
Call J up and close a deal
I still got my money

My fragrance on and they love my smell
I still got my money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got my money

My pocket's deep, and it never ends
I still got my money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
I still got my money

Ohhhh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out

Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out

Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
