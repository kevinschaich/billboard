I'm booking myself a one way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you baby is a waste of time

Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
Got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

But I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me baby? Let's be crazy

I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does

I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catchin' up calls and a date sometimes
A love that revels and stills believes
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah

Oh, I know we're crazy, yeah

But I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy
You with me baby? Let's be crazy

No! I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy

Yeah, look at us baby, tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough, maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love…
Let's be crazy!

Who cares if we're crazy, we gotta be crazy
I know that we're crazy, so let's be crazy
Yeah…
