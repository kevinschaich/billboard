Well, all the parties on the streets are talking, store front mannequins sleeping in lights
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kind of style
But boy you know it's been a while

I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh anymore

I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh 
But you ain't gettin' uh uh if you don't come pick me up (damn)
Show me off (wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not!

And I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

I don't know why you don't take me downtown like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be countin on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh anymore
Yeah I don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it
