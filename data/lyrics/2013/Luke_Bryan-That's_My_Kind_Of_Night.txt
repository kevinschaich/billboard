(Uh, uh)

I got that real good feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35s
Purdy girl by my side

You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way down
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country rock hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain (make it rain!)

You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way down
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

My kinda, your kind is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Gonna get our love on
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Time to get our buzz on

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way down
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, that’s my kind of night! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, that’s my kind of night! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, that’s my kind of night! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Come on!
