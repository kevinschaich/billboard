I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I don't care

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the Seventies, but I'm a Nineties bitch

I love it!
I love it!
