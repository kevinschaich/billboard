I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying
"Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an I.V. baby could I bear!
Being away from you
I found the vein put it in here!

I live for the applause, applause, applause!
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me!
The applause, applause, applause!

Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!
Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!

(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!

I've overheard your theory:
Nostalgia's for geeks!
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read!

One second, I'm a Koons
Then suddenly the Koons is me!
Pop culture was in art
Now, art's in pop culture in me!

I live for the applause, applause, applause!
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me!
The applause, applause, applause!

Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!
Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!

(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!

Touch, touch
Touch, touch, now

I live for the applause, applause, applause!
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me!
The applause, applause, applause!

Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!
Give me that thing that I love!
I'll turn the lights out!
Put your hands up make'em touch!
Make it real loud!

(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud!
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch!
