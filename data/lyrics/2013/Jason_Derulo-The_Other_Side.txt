In the beginning, I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin', smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer, till you were eatin' off my spoon
And coming over and we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect but we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous, so just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Yes, we do, yeah)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore (Oh no)
If we walk down this road we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, so tonight, kiss me like it's do or die (Kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

Take me to the other side
And take me to the other side
Kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
