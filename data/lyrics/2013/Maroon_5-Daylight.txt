Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
Why am I, holding on?
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it, come so fast?

This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting back the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard, cause I know
When the sun comes up, I will leave
This is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
(Yeah)
Oh-whoa
(Yeah)

Oh-whoa
(Yeah)
Oh-whoa
(Yeah)
Oh-whoa
(Yeah)
Oh-whoa
