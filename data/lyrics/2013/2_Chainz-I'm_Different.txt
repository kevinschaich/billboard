I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 

Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Middle finger up to my competition

I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

Pull to the scene, but my roof gone
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on

Everything hot, skip lukewarm
Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy
But the stripper happy but they wish had me

And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi

Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
Look back at it, look back at it
Then I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high attic
I am so high like an attic

I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 

Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Middle finger up to my competition

I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly

When it go in her belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along

I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Dre told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head

Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 

Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing 
Middle finger up to my competition

I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
I'm different, yeah I'm different 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
