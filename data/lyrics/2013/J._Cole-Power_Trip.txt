Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night
