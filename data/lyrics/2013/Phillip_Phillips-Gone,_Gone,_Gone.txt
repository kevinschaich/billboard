When life leaves you high and dry 
I’ll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I’ll shut down the city lights 
I’ll lie, cheat I’ll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

When enemies are at your door 
I’ll carry you away from war
if you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string 
I’ll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me
And I will do it

For you, for you
Baby I’m not movin’ on
I’ll love you long after you’re gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I’ll love you long after you go
And long after you’re gone gone gone

When you fall like a statue 
I’m gonna be there to catch you
Put on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty 
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need, what do you need?

I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me
So I will do it

For you, for you
Baby I’m not movin’ on
I’ll love you long after you’re gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I’ll love you long after you go
And long after you’re gone gone gone

You’re my backbone
You’re my cornerstone
You’re my crutch when my legs stop movin’
You’re my head start
You’re my rugged heart
You’re the pulse that I've always needed

Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum my heart never stops beatin’

For you, for you
Baby I’m not movin’ on
I’ll love you long after you’re gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I’ll love you long after you go

For you, for you
Baby I’m not movin’ on
I’ll love you long after you’re gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I’ll love you long, long after you go

Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum baby don’t stop beatin’
Like a drum my heart never stops beatin’ for you

And long after you’re gone gone gone
I'll love you long after you’re gone gone gone
