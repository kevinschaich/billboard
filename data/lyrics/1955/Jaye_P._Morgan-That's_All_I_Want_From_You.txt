A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

A sunny day with bolts up to the sky
A kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down, oh show me that you care
Remember when you give, you also get your share
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste
Tomorrow might not come, when dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down, oh show me that you care
Remember when you give, you also get your share
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste
Tomorrow might not come, when dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you
