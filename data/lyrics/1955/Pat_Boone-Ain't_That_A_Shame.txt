You made me cry 
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame 
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame 

You broke my heart 
When you said we're apart 
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame 

Oh well goodbve 
Although I'll cry 
Ain't that a shame 
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame
