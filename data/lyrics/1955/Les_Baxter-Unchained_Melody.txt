Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me

Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me, unchain me

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me
