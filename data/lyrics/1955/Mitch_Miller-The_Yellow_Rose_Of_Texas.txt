There's a yellow rose in Texas that I am gonna see
Nobody else could miss her, not half as much as me
She cried so when I left her, it was like it broke her heart
And if I ever find her, we never more will part

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me

Where the Rio Grand is flowing and the starry skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promise to return and not to leave her so

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me

Now I'm gonna find her for my heart is full of woe
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily, she'll loves me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me
