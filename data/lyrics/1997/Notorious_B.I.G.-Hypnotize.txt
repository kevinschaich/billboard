Uh, uh, uh, c'mon

Hah, sicka than your average Poppa
Twist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn

Dead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to bruise crews who
Do something to us, talk go through us

Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (hehehe)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M3

Bang every MC easily, busily (take that)
Recently niggaz frontin' ain't sayin' nuttin' (nope)
So I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece (thank you God), with my peeps

Packin', askin' who want it
You got it, nigga flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

Biggie Biggie Biggie, can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid (uh)

Biggie Biggie Biggie, (uh-huh) can't you see (uh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (hip to)
And I just love your flashy ways (uh-huh)
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid (hah)

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (that's right)
All Philly hoes, dough and Moschino (c'mon)
Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi (hah)

Now who's the real dookie, meanin' who's really the shit
Them niggaz ride dicks, Frank White push the sticks
On the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass

Gon' blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars

I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plantiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shhh)

Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)
Richer than Richie, till you niggaz come and get me

Biggie Biggie Biggie, can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid

Biggie Biggie Biggie, can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways

I can fill ya wit real millionaire shit (I can feel ya)
Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly
Wreck it buy a new one
Your crew run run run, your crew run run

I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen, call me round ten

Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (that's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo

Tell them hoe, take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em wit the force like Obi, dick black like Toby (Obi, Toby)
Watch me roam like Gobe, lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe show me, homey (say what, homie?)
