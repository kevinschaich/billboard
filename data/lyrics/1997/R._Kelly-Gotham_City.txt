I'm looking over the skyline of the city.
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime.
How next door to happiness lives sorrow,
And signals of solution in the sky.

(chorus)
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace
for everyone of us.
We all need it, can't live without it
A Gotham City (oh yeah)

How sleeping awake because of fear. (ohh yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears.
How we need a place where we can go,
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)

(chorus 2x)

Yet in the middle of stormy weather,
We won't stumble and we won't fall.
I know a place where all this shelter..

(repeat chorus until end)
