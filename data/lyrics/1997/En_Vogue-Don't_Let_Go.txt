What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon it would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'.....

What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

I often fantasize the stars above are watching you,
They know my heart, it speaks to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes I'd pretend I was you and lose control

There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'.....

What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

Runnin in and outta my life
Has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's gotta choose
We can make it if we try
For the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

(Can't keep a running)
(In and outta my life outta my outta my life)
(You've got the right, you've got the right, I said ayou've got the
right to loooose controol yeah)

What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

Don't let go
Don't let go

What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

Don't you want to be (don't let go)
Hold me tight and don't let go (don't let go)
