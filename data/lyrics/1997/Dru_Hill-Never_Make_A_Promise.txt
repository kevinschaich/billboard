I don't have to think about
I never been in love
Well, I only dreamed about
I wondered what it was

But now I think I know
It's clear to me
You make me understand
I'm so proud to say I love you
I'm so proud to be your man, yes I am

I promise I'll never hurt you
I'll never make you cry, no
I promise I'll never hit you
Cross my heart and hope to die
Cuz I know I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you warm
I'll keep you satisfied
I'll be your sunshine in the morning
Be your everything at night

1 -     You told me what you wanted
I gave you what you need
I told you that I love you
Make it good for you and me
And I never make a promise
That I can't keep
That ain't me

Repeat 1

Ain't no way to get around it
Now you're stuck with me, baby, baby
Did you know that you'd be surrounded
By my love and ecstasy
This is the start of one great love affair
That's never, never, never gonna end
We can share the world together
Oh, this is where it begun

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Oh, girl I'll stand by you
If you give me your hand
I'll make love to you baby
Your every wish is my command
Let's play out your fantasies
Oh, I can lose your mind
Take you places you ain't never been before
I promise you it's alright

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

If I make a promise to you
Then baby that's what I'll do
I have nothing to lose
I give my whole world to you
(I'll never make a promise that I can't keep)
Never, never, oh no, no, no, no, no

I'm a man of my word
For you I'm always concerned
That you'll never be hurt
It's for better or worse
(I'll never make a promise that I can't keep)

Ad lib until fade
