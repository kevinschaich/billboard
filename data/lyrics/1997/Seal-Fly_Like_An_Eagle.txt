Time keeps on slippin'
Into the future 
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future 

I want to fly like an eagle 
To the sea 
Fly like an eagle 
Let my spirit carry me 
I want to fly 
Fly right into the future

Wanna feed the babies 
Who can't get enough to eat 
Wanna shoe the children 
With no shoes on their feet 
Wanna house the people 
Livin' in the street 
Oh, oh, there's a solution 

I want to fly like an eagle 
To the sea 
Fly like an eagle 
Let that spirit carry me 
I want to fly 
Oh ya,
Fly right into the future

Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future 
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future 
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future 

Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...

I want to fly like an eagle 
To the sea 
Fly like an eagle 
Let that spirit carry me 
I want to fly 
Fly right into the future

Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future 
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' 
Into the future
