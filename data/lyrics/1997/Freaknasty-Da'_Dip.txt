Spoken:
This goes out to all the women in the world, especially her.
You know it don't even matter your age, don't even matter yo color.
Yo fellas I ain't forget about y'all.
This is for everybody who like to dance.
Just listen to what I'm sayin' and do it, and take a chance.


I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can dip down low in a rolling grind

Get on the floor like I said before
Y'all remember that down low
Just put a little dip with it
Now put those hips with it

Pop it push it rock it roll it
Can't control it, I can hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance y'all

I know you like it so don't try to fight it
Turn around baby let me see it from the back, yeah I like it like that
Get up now, roll those hips drop down double up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see can y'all do this right like me

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can dip down low in a rolling grind

Back again with the second verse
It's all clean so I'm not gonna curse
Droppin' bass like a bad habit
Love all women cause I got to have it

Comin' at y'all in stereo
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo
Hang on baby 'cause the ride is rough
And don't stop till you get enough

Have them girls in the front
Now or later just bumpin' that rump
Raise it up let me see that round
Slap it girl, make it jiggle round

Round and round that rump goes
Where it stop yo no one knows
Freak Nasty wanna see 
Can y'all do this right like me

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can dip down low in a rolling grind



Announcer:
Well alright y'all.
If you ain't dippin', you must be trippin'.
If you ain't doin the down low, you gots to go.
To the people that's movin' slow on the dance flo', yo DJ pump it up some more



It's off to the show in the limo
Before the show gotta make that dough
Pay them girls what they worth
Slip that money under that skirt

Take it off baby let me see
You might get a little more loot chi-chi
String-havin' that's so much fun
Playin' that side, between them buns

Shawty got it on like moms
Teasin' me and she know I'm starvin'
Lick you up then lick you down
But I ain't finished girl turn around

Lick you up and down your back
'Cause I'm that freaky, I'm freaky like that
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right like me

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
then we can dip down low in a rolling grind

Settin' it off to another level
You diggin' freak nasty without a shovel
This is my world; I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so what's up

Yo DJ, when the party's getting slow
Throw on this jam on and watch them flow
Takin' over like in '94
When I had the world gettin' down low

New Orleans born ATL-livin'
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin'
My juice is sweet like Georgia peaches
Women suck it up like leeches (uh-huh)

It feels so good you must admit
You like this shh
Yeah y'all know the song
So come on won't you sing along

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip

I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
