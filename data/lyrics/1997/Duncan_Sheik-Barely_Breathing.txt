I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far

I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway 

I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
