Oh, oo-o-oh, come on, ooh, yeah
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) All those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) Yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) Even though you know I'd die for you
(You lied to me) Yes, I cried, yes, I cried

(Return of the Mack) It is
(Return of the Mack) Come on
(Return of the Mack) Oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) Here I am
(Return of the Mack) Once again
(Return of the Mack) Pump up the world
(Return of the Mack) Watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) Here I go

So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

(You lied to me) 'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) But you did, but you do
(You lied to me) All these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) But I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) Here it is
(Return of the Mack) Hold on
(Return of the Mack) Don't you know
(You know that I'll be back) Here I go
(Return of the Mack) Oh little girl
(Return of the Mack) Wants my pearl
(Return of the Mack) Up and down
(You know that I'll be back) Round and round

(You lied to me) 'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) But you did, but you do
(You lied to me) All these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) But I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) It is
(Return of the Mack) Come on
(Return of the Mack) Oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) Here I am
(Return of the Mack) Once again
(Return of the Mack) Pump up the world
(Return of the Mack) Watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) Don't you know

(Return of the Mack) Here it is
(Return of the Mack) Hold on
(Return of the Mack) Don't you know
(You know that I'll be back) Here I go
(Return of the Mack) Oh little girl
(Return of the Mack) Wants my pearl
(Return of the Mack) Up and down
(You know that I'll be back) Round and round.
