When I was young I knew everything
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

Can't be held responsible
But she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember 
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We were merely freshmen 
We were only freshmen
