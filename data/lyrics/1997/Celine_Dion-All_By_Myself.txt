When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore, oh, oh

All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh, oh, oh
Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore, oh
By myself anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, all by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never needed anyone
