All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa oh..
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure,
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused... 
Now I'm all cried out, over you

Oooo
I'm over you, oh yeah you
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh why was I such a fool, baby (Why was I such a fool) 
Oh yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong?

Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
(tears will cause an inferno baby)
Romance often fades
Why should I take the blame? 
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected

(I) I gave you all of me
How was I to know
You were awaken so easily
(I) I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out) over you 
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
You (left me so confused) 
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
Now I'm all cried out 
Over you 

Please forgive me baby, oh
Please forgive
