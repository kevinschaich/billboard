Everybody put your hands together
Whooo, mmmm, yeah
Girl I love you so
112, listen

Girl if I told you I love you
That doesn't mean that I don't care, oooh
And when I tell you I need you
Don't you think that I'll can never be there, ooooh

1 - Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into
Deception and lies
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind
I'm only saying what's in my heart

2 - Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love
won't lie but we won't know unless we give it a try
give it a try

Girl when I ask you to trust me
That doesn't mean that I'm gonna cheat on you
Cuz I'm gonna never do anything to hurt you
Or misleaded you, I love you

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Ain't no doubt about it
Lord no, I really mean it
I rather die before I, before I lie to you
Never wanna leave her
Ain't no life without her
Never gonna leave, never gonna go, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, ohhhh

Repeat 2

Repeat until fade
