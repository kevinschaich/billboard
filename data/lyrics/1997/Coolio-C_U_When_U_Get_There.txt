Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending that your loc'n but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy?
'Cause now you done lost a hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a bustler
And though I got love for you
I know I can't trust you
'Cause my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin ta preach
I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation than faith
I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet
By a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it's way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we got a later start
But I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the times somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuffle and struggle till i'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reachin' sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' wit the sound pumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
Ahh ahhh etc

You need to loosen up
And live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feel
And for your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that
Too busy tryin' a stack
And keep up with the Jones's taking advantage of your own
The realist homies that you been knowin for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right 
When it's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous 
Yes I know time seems strife
And problems seem endless
But in times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow
We got one push to give and one life to live
So stand up for something or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make your peace
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
