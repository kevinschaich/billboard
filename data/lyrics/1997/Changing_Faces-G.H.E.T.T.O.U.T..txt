Sittin' there, sittin' there
Sittin' there
All alone

I been feeling kinda strange lately
I don't know what's going on, baby
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's telling me some bullshit is going down


Boy is it someone else you're seeking
Is it someone else
My vitals' telling me you're creeping
Finding numbers in your jeans
You're talking in your sleep
Faded letters written by me get o-u-t


No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more staring at the phone
'Cos I can do better by myself

Yeah, it's obvious how things have changed within the year
Just give me half of the rent and get out of here
No more talking save your lying for somebody else
Keep on walking 'cos I can do better by myself







I gave you all, all of my time
But you would not know a good thing
If it stares you in your face







Oh oh oh oh
Hey ey ey ey
Oh oh oh oh
