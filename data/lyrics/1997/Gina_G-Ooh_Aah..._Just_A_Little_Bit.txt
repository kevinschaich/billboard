You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong am I so unkind
Show me the way don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm just thinking of you

Chorus
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good let's go all the way
It's got to be set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

Chorus

What can you do for me
Oh what can you do
Cos I feel, so alive
I feel your love inside ohhhh

Just a little bit, little bit more,
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a little bit, little bit more,
Just a little bit, woah

Chorus to fade
