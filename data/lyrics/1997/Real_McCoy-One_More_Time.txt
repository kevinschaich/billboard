One more time
Let's do it again
Show no shame,
Just call my name
One more time
Again and again
Don't you want to
Play my game?

24-7 I will make you feel like heaven
I turn you upside down
I spin you round and round
I put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine,
Let's do it one more time


You spin me round and round and Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and Hit me to the feeling

Chorus

Play me, play me baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me,
Play me baby,
Play me, don't stop don't stop

Do it, just do it, let's do it
Again again
Keep it going on,
Show no shame,
Come and play the game,
How did I know that I would
Do this to you
Now that I've made you mine
Let's do it one more time

You spin me round and round and Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and Hit me to the feeling

Chorus x2

Play me, play me baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me
Play me baby
Play me, don't stop don't stop
You spin me round and round and Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and Hit me to the feeling

Chorus x2

Play me, play me baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me
Play me baby
Play me, don't stop don't stop

Do it just do it
Do it just do it
Do it just do it
Do it just do it, just do it One More Time!
