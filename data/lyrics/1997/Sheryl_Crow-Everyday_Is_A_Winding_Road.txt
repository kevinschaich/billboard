I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He said he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there but the brochure looks nice

Jump in, let's go, lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life

Jump in, let's go, lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on coffee and nicotine
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen
Were ever real, were ever really happening

Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer

Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer feeling fine

Every day is a winding road
Every day is a winding road
