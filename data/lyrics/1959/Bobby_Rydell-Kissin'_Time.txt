They're kissin' in Cleveland, Kansas City, too
They're wailin' in Wildwood, back at Waterloo
They're smoochin' all over, even in St. Loo
So uh-baby get ready, I'm a-kissin' you

Oh, baby 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So treat me right, a-don't-a make-a me fight
The Battle of New Orleans tonight

They're kissin' on beaches, sea to shining sea
Smoochin' on benches, near the Christmas tree
Lipstick on collars down in Tennessee
So a-baby, come on now, start by kissin' me

Oh, oh 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So press your tasty lips to mine
Sweeter than wine and feels so fine, wa-hoo!!

Mmm, 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So treat me right, a-don't-a make-a me fight
The Battle of New Orleans tonight

They're kissin' in drive-ins, you too, Baltimore
Rockin' at dances, land and sea and shore
Then it's off to Dee-troit, they all know the score
So, a-baby, oh baby, what are we waitin' for?

Oh, 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA

FADE
So press your tasty lips to mine
Sweeter than wine
