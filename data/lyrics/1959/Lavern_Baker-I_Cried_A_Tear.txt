I cried a tear because of you
I cried a tear because we're through
I cried a tear, what else could I do
But cry and sigh for love of you

I felt a tear fall in my heart
You fooled me so, I wasn't smart
I can't believe that we must part
Come back to stay, let's make a new start

I cried a tear because of you
I cried a tear because we're through
Please make my dreams of you come true
Don't make me cry a tear for you
Don't make me cry a tear for you
