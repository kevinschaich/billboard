Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna

I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same

'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

Now that you're gone
I'm left all alone
All by myself
To wander and roam

'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

Oh, darlin', now that you're gone
I don't know what I'll do
All the time and all my love
For you

I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same

'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
