I could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you 
And I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you 
With you to stand beside me I'll never be alone 
And what more could I long for than to have you for my own 

My only desire is loving you eternally 
For no, no other love could ever mean so much to me 
So if you say you love me forever I'll be true 
And what more could I long for than to live my life with you

I could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you 
And I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you
