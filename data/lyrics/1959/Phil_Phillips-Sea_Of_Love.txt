Come with me my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea, of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea, of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

I want to tell you
How much I love you
I want to tell you
How much I love you
