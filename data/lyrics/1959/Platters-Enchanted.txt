Living is a dream when you make it seem enchanted
Lovers take for granted all the world's aglow, they ought to know
When you touch a star then you really are enchanted
Find a seed and plant it, love will make it grow

It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight

Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes

It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight

Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes
