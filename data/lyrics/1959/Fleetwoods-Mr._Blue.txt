Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no
And his silver turned to blue

Like him, I am doubtful
That your love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly
Proving your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around, heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr.

I won't tell you
While you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too

But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
