Someday, someway
You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darling, you're going to need me again
It's just a matter of time

Go on, go on
Until you reach the end of the line
But I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down

I know, I know
That one day, you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time
