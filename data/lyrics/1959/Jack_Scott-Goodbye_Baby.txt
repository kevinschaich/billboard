Ooh, bye bye
Ooh, bye bye

Goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
I'm gonna leave you now

Goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
Johnny's going away

You were wrong, pretty baby, bye bye
Oh, so wrong, pretty baby, bye bye
Yes, so wrong, pretty baby, bye bye
Please don't you cry

Oh, goodbye baby, baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, baby, bye bye
I'm gonna leave you now

Baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye
Baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye
Baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye
Baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye

Oh, goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
Goodbye baby, bye bye
Johnny's going away

Take my hand, pretty baby, bye bye
One more time, pretty baby, bye bye
Take my hand, pretty baby, bye bye
Hope you'll understand

Oh, oh
Goodbye, bay-hey, hey, hey
Goodbye, bay-hey, hey, hey

Ooh, bye bye
Ooh, bye bye
