Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so

Sixteen candles
make a lovely light
But not as bright as your eyes tonight

Blow out the candles,
make your wish come true
For I'll be wishing
that you love me, too

You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen

Sixteen candles
in my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so

You're only sixteen
But you're my teenage queen
Oh, you're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen

Sixteen candles
in my heart will glow
For ever and ever
for I love you so
For I love you so!
