They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Oh, I of course replied
Something here inside 
Cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
Oh, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes
