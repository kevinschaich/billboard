(spoken): Frankie, where ever you are, I love you 

Though you've found a new love, 
I still miss you so 
I just can't forget you, 
But you'll never know 
Frankie, my darling, 
I'll never let you see me cry 

Once I was your sweetheart, 
now I'm just a friend 
Once you really loved me, 
now I just pretend 
Frankie, my darling, 
I'll never let you see me cry 

Oh, Frankie, 
I'd rather hide these teardrops deep down inside 
I'm crying, 
But you'll never see I'd rather cry than have you pity me 

Though my nights are lonely 
Since you went away 
I'll always keep this secret 
Deep within my heart 
Frankie, my darling 
I'll never let you see me cry 

(spoken): Frankie, where ever you are, I love you
