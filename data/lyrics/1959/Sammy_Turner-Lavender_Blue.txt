Lavender blue
Dilly-dilly
Lavender green
If I were king
Dilly-dilly
I'd need a queen

Whoa-oh, who told me so
Dilly-dilly
Who told me so
I told myself
Dilly-dilly
I told me so

If your dilly-dilly heart
Feels a dilly-dilly way
If you'll answer yes
In a pretty little church
On a dilly-dilly day
You'll be wed in a dilly-dilly dress of

Lavender blue
Dilly-dilly
Lavender green
Then I'll be king
Dilly-dilly
You'll be my queen

Then I'll be king
Dilly-dilly
You'll be my queen

(Lavender blue, dilly-dilly)
