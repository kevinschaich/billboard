She comes on like a rose,
But everybody knows,
She get you and such.
You can look but you better not touch!

Poison Ivy,
Poison Ivy,
Late at night while your sleepin', 
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' around.

She's pretty as a daisy,
But look out man, she's crazy!
She'll really do you in.
If you let her get under your skin!

Poison Ivy,
Poison Ivy,
Late at night while your sleepin',
Poison Ivy comes creapin' around.

Measles' make you mumpy and mumps' will make you lumpy,
And Chicken pox will make you jump and twitch.
The common cold will fool you,
And whooping cough will cool you.
But Poison Ivy Lord will make you itch!

Your gonna need an ocean,
Of calamine lotion.
You'll be scratchin' like a hound,
The minute you start to mess around!

Poison Ivy,
Poison Ivy,
Late at night while your sleepin',
Poison Ivy comes creapin' around.

Measles' make you mumpy and mumps' will make you lumpy,
And Chicken pox will make you jump and twitch.

And whooping cough will cool you.

Of calamine lotion.
You'll be scratchin' like a hound,
The minute you start to mess around!

Poison Ivy,
Poison Ivy,
Late at night while your sleepin',
Poison Ivy comes creapin' around.
