When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
And she starts trading her baby toys for boys
When that once-shy little sleepyhead
Learns about love and its lilt
You can bet that the change
Is more than from cotton to silk

If a miss wants to be kissed instead of cuddled
And to this you are in doubt as what to say
When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
Then she's old enough to give her heart away

When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings

And to this you are in doubt as what to say
When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
Then she's old enough to give her heart away

Yes, she's old enough to give her heart away
