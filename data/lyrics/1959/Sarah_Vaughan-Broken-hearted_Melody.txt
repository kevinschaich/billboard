Br-oooo-ken hearted me-eee-lo-dy
Ooooonce you were our song of love.
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da))
His tender love. Oh,
Broken hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away.
Night and day they play.
But, broken hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight;
Suddenly I found: I was out of bound

Brooooken hearted melody
Ooooonce you were my song of love.
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love. Oh,
Broken hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me
Sing to him until he hears,
For when he returns no more will he be,
A broken hearted melody.
Oooooooo, oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo,
Oooooooo, oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo. . .
