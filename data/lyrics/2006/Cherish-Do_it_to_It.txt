(Verse 1)
Step out the Caddy Deville 
It's on a base of steel 
Them boys checkin us out 
Know when we dress to kill 
Struttin in the club, it's dark 
But still got my shades on 
I hear the Dj mixin Youngbloodz 
To that Whisper Song 

(Bridge)
We from the city that make it Okay to 
To make clubbin' a year-round holiday 
So if you feelin right, grab the Kryptonite 
If this yo song tonight, then it's on tonight 

(Hook)
Bounce wit it drop wit it 
Lean wit it rock wit it

Do it do it do it do it

(Verse 2)
No need to ask where I'm from 
You already know 
I represent the A from my head to my toes 
Step on the dance floor 
Watch and learn cuz here I go 
I throw my hands up 
And work my body to the floor 

(Bridge)
We from the city that make it Okay to

So if you feelin right, grab the Kryptonite 
If this yo song tonight, then it's on tonight
