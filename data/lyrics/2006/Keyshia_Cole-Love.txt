(Verse 1)

I used to think that I wasn't fun enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
why you playing games, what's this all about
And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't see in me
But I guess it was all just make-believe

(Chorus)

Oh, Love
never knew what I was missing
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found......
Love
never knew what I was missin'
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found.....

(Verse 2)

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty
my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you....
My rainy days fade away, when you
come around please tell me baby
why you go so far away
Why you go...

(Chorus)

Love......
never knew what I was missing
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found......
Love
never knew what I was missin'
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found.....

I found you
yeaaahhhh
oooooo

Now you go, what am I gonna do
I'm sooo empty
my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on baby without you....
Rainy days fade away
when you come around
say your here to stay
With me boy
I don't want you to leave me
I need you.........

(Chorus)

(fade out)
