Yea these niggaz like me, haters want to fight me
Yea these niggaz mad 'cause I came up over night B
Yea I switch it up I got 9 kuff tightly
So you betta do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yep I'm superclean rock jeans wit a white tee
Niggaz round here soft but like niggaz want to fight me
If you had some figures you will be just like me
Yea these niggaz mad 'cause I shining like a light B
Niggaz talking yep in there muthaf**kin throwback
It ain't real, you know, that's Muhammedz where they sold dat
We stepping on these niggaz like a muthaf**kin door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures call me Kodak
These hoes goin crazy like think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing in the marker and you no dat
If Yo bitch chosed up and she don't want to go back
We stackin big faces 'cause we still spending throwbacks!


Ohh I think they like me 


Haters want 2 fight me I'm snatching ya ass up
First nigga act up first nigga get bust
Just ta gettin shredded, while im twirlin n switchin swords
T-shirt stravaganza (franchize the white tee boyz)
Self made self paid we latch around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well get down in ya brown tee
My hundred throwback we sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one (hell naw dat dont sight me!)
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice peace
Ear piece icy they straight up like me


You heard pimpin playa (they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision burners with ice blingers
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us 'cause
Role out the red carpet high 5 to show us love
Carry barretas count cheddar we trend settas
I'm a franchize niggga have a mil or betta



A young nigga
I luv to muthaf**kin fight
but when shit get thick I grab the k he grab the pipe
so when my muthaf**kin partnas
when they rumble when they right
strap up in all black, so make dem suckas see da light
some people say im crazy, my eye stay lazy
the neck so sweet, ten bricks for the 80
killin f**k niggas when they dont wanna pay me
ones on my shirt, stay clean so i made it
we back on the block, servin glass to the jay
nigga gotta glass jar, swappin shit, breakin face
gotta yays and a bar, clean ones, stay laced
gotta king fitch tell her get the f**k out tha way
wet paint, big shoes, move motors lets race
young nigga tryin ta get it, wat i care about a case
if u want me come n get me bitch i gotta AK
see yall nigga, me n my click n we dont muthaf**kin play
