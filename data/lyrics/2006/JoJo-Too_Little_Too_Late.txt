Come with me
Stay the night
Just say the words but boy it don't feel right
What do ya expect me to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You take my hand and you say you've changed
But boy you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game (You know it's just too little too late)

So let me on down now
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know...

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong 
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me you just like the chase
So be real, it doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)

Yeah yeah... it's just too little too late... mhmmm

I was young and in love
I gave you everything but it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate (You know it's just too little too late)
Go find someone else and letting you go

I'm loving myself
You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know...

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong 
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me you just like the chase
So be real, it doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)

I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give (I have so much to give)
With a player like you I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live...
Ohhhh... mmm no...
It's just too little too late
Yeah...

It's just too little too late (Too late oh too late)
A little too wrong
And I can't wait (Yeah...)
But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me you just like the chase (You just like the chase)
So be real, it doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)

Yeah...
You know it's just too little too late
Oh...
I can't wait
No no oh...

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong 
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me you just like the chase
So be real, it doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)
