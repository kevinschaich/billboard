I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place 
I was looking for something I couldn't replace 
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back 
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road 
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known,
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go 
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road 
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
