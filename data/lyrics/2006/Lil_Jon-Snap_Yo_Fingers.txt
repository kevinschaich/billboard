Snap ya fingers and then rock wit it 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, dun drop wit it 
Do a step wit it put your hips wit it 
All my ladies let me see ya put a twist wit it 

You can't do like me, I'm by myself 
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else 
What's happenin', what's up 
Got da purp fired up 
What's happenin', what's up 
Got Patrone in my cup 

I pop,( I pop ) I drank ( I drank )

I'm blowed, to tha go 
don't know how tha hell I'm gettin home 

(Hook: (2x)) 

(E-40:) 
Straight from da back, posted in tha act  
Bout to hit tha club, we been mobbin' all day 
Drinkin' on some rossa dyin' off Patrone 
VIP style, strapped wit my chrome 



Look around tha club, what do I see 
Everybody rockin' side to side to tha beat 
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to tha groove 
All by they self ( self ) that's tha new move 

Nigga where I'm from, we like to go dumm dumm 
I'm soakin' up tha game, I'm seein' how its done 
I ask shawty what they call it, she said tha Pool Palace 
straight from Bankhead, I said you good at it 

Do what cha do, you and ya crew 
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too 
The mo' that I drank, tha more it's lookin' smooth 
I's nuthin to a boss, I can do tha shit too! 

(Hook: (2x)) 

(Sean Paul:) 
Chillin' in tha bip, yeah we get crunk 
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk 
Rollin' up tha kush, put it in tha air 
I'm throwin' up tha E's to let em' know we in here 

Brand new shoes, brand new tool 
Pull out tha ol school, 'cause I'm feelin' real cool 
Yeah I'm from tha 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin' 
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock BITCH! 

Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from tha deck 
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck 
Smokin' on tha best, we don't f**k wit dat mess 
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this 

Yeah I'm back to tha track, back to tha snap 
1, 2 step, then you gotta lean back 
Dis is how we do it in tha 'A town' 
(and if you ain't know) this how it go down!!! 

(Hook: (2x)) 

Hey! Hey!
