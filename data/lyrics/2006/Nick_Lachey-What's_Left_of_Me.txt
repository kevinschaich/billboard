Watch my life,
Pass me by,
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't want to waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

Yeah...

'Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be,
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside,
Little by little,
No where to go,
But going out of my mind
In endless circles,
Running from myself until,
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be,
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster,
Barely breathing,
Give me something,
To believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head

Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again

'Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
A hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
What's left of me?

I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out my
Out my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?

Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me...
