Whoa whoa
Do do do, do do
Yeah
Yeah

Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her?
(Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n never seen before

I said yo, tell her girls I want to meet her
(Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I got to stop her

Or should I talk about her smile?
(It's been said before)
Or what about her style?
(Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door, I got to go for mine

I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I'd love to keep you here with me oh baby

Now shorty grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry about it
We just one two, step, one two, step

Now if the music is moving too fast
(Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter
(Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say
(Aw yeah, aw yeah)

Yo, I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

I want to be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart

So many things I want to tell you
I think that I should start by saying yo

I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she get it, there she is I got to stop her

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I'd love to keep you here with me oh baby

Ha, whoo!
