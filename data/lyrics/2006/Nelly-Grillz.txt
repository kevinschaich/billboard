Rob the jewelry store and tell em make me a grill
And da whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold


Yo, we 'bout to start an epidemic with this one
Ya'll know what dis is, so So Def


Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot

I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh)in my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife b

V V and studded, you can tell when they cut it
Ya see, my granmama hate it, but my li'l mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin'

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothin', only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood, just say

Smile for me daddy (What you lookin at?)
Let me see ya grill  (Let ya see my what?)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

I want to see your grill (You wanna see my what?)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamond and da bottom row's gold


What it do baby, it's da ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth lookin' somethin' like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil
Smilin', showin' off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real

My motivation is from thirty pointers V VS the furniture
My mouthpiece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear that's captivatin'
But it's my smile that's got these on-lookers spectatin'

My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carats than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grillz

Smile for me daddy (What you lookin at?)
Let me see ya grill  (Let ya see my what?)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

Gipp got dem yellows, got dem purples, got dem reds
Lights gon' hit ya and make you woozie in ya head
You can catch me in my too short drop
Mouth got colors like a Froot Loop box


Dis what it do when da low, ice grill country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangster's bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot them on da top in da bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham


I ain't dissin' nobody but let's bring it to da light
Yeah, was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah, these hos can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some fours, you can see my mouth jewelry


I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like fabulous chain
And the other set is same, got my name in the mold
Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold (come on)
