Honey, why you calling me so late?
It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye

But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(And I never wanna say goodbye)
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

Honey, why you calling me so late?
