The dynamic duo.

(Spoken:)
wow wow wow wow.....its what your body sayin.

Chris Brown is in the building.

(Verse 1:)
The young boy just turned 16
and i got 64's and hot bikes that I rock

Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,
but all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.

Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, cause you speaking that slang that i talk.

That sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all this jeans(?) may never see me.

(Chorus: 2x)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what i got (gimme that)
I know you like it how i lean in the lac,
You can be in the bac saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

(Repeat Song: 2x)
