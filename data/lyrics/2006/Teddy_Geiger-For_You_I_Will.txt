Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have

Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
'Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed

Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I want to be exposed and not be afraid to fall

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood, yeah I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
