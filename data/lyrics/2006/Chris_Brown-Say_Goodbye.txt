Look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know
But it's just 
There's some things I got to get off my chest alright

Yeah

Baby, come in, sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say, so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been 
No walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I'm finished, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
'Cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world, and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart, and I wanna know

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryin'a say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl how you not gonna see it?

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry

Do you hear me crying?
There's never a right time

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
(About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
(Oh, no, it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go
(Go) 
Our separate ways
(Ways)
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye
