Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price

Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn around and I let it ride

Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart
And I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
