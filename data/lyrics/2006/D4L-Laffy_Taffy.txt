Waddle, stop you watchin' me

Big ol' ass you shakin' bitch
Close your mouth and don't say shit
Bend on over and hit a split

Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, your ankles swell

Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that ho
All the money just hit the floor

I wanna poor on you

Just keep that ass shakin'
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a playa
And sip that Grey Goose

Feelin' all loose
'Cause girl you're on your job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes

Workin' them micros
On da stilettos
You made it skeet skeet skeet
Like a water hose (candy gurl)

Got me goin' in my pocket
Pullin' out more dough
Let the waitress know
I need to order 500 more

You besta believe, later on we headed to the mo
So go on and pack them bags
And let's mothafuckin' go
I'm waitin on your fine ass
At da front door, girl you don't know

I'mma toss the laffy taffy (what)
Toss it, flip it and slap it (what)
Bust a couple of nuts
And get right back at it
