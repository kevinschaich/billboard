I found you, Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the player's club for bout a month or two
Put a cat on it then see what it do
I found you, Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me

Put a tan on it then see what it do

Get it ripe, get it right, hit it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, hit it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, hit it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, hit it tight

Girl I don't need you, but you need me
Take it off, let it flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let 'em tell they self
And you ain't gotta sell sex, girl it sell itself
Like nuttin' else, yeah I'm a country boy
But that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Ain't life grand, live it up Betty
Here go the whisper song, baby this is us, ready
Put it on me, enthusiastically
Whatever it is that you do, you do it admirably
And I ain't choose it, that thang chose me
It's Bubba K and Ying Yang all the way in this thang, go

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere

Quarter to twelve and we just came in
Bubba gon' make it spark with the Ying Yang Twins
Sippin' on Patron, blub blub blub
Shorty in a thong, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ass get to jiggling, motherfuckin' wiggling
Keep that thang shakin' like she frostbit shivering
Ass be delivering all type of flashes
Cashes got these ho's shaking like molasses
Sssh *whispering* let me whisper in your ear
Get yourself together go and buy some new gear
Do something with your hair then hit the club
Shakin' ass at the fellas, goin' show some love
But that wasn't in just a minute ago
I guarantee you will make all the dough
So go and do your thang baby work what you got
And get what you want, make that money, don't let it make you

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere

Hi there, how are things
I once was a breast man, now it seems
That ever since I had the pleasure of gettin' you together
Your chest is just whatever, I found the buried treasure
Yes ma'am, here's the plan
Meet me over yonder, okay, don't play
I'll bring the whoop whoop, you bring your cook book
And I'm a fix that stuff up, everything is just good

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere
