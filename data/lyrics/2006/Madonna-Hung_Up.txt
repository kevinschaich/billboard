Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting for you 

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait 
No time to hesitate 
Those who run seem to have all the fun 
I'm caught up 
I don't know what to do 

Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
I don't know what to do 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone 
The lights are on but there's no one home 
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two 
And I'm done 
I'm hanging up on you 

I can't keep on waiting for you 
I know that you're still hesitating 
Don't cry for me 
'Cause I'll find my way 
You'll wake up one day 
But it'll be too late 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Every little thing
Every little thing 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 

Waiting for your call
Waiting for your call 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
Time goes by so slowly 
So slowly

So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly

So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly

I don't know what to do 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Every little thing that you say or do 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you 
Waiting for your call 
Baby, night and day 
I'm fed up 
I'm tired of waiting on you 

Every little thing
Every little thing 
I'm hung up 
I'm hung up on you

Waiting for your call
Waiting for your call 
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
