Ciara
He said 
Hi, my name is so and so 
Baby, can you tell me yours? 
You look like you came to do 
One thing (Set it off)
I started on the left 
And I had to take him to the right 
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night 

You tryin, admit it 
But you just can't fight the feelin' inside 
You know it
And I can see it in your eyes 
You want me 
You smooth as a mother 
You're so undercover 
By the way that you was watchin' me 

Ooh, uh 
The way you look at me 
I'm feelin' you, uh 
I just can't help it 
Tryin' to keep it cool, uh 
I can feel it in the beat, uh 
When you do those things to me, uh 
Don't let nothin' stop you 
Move, ring the alarm 
The club is jumpin' now 
So get up

I said: Ciara's on you radio
Everybody, turn it up
Spicy just like hot sauce 
Careful, you might burn it up 
You can do the pop lock 
Ragtime, don't stop 
That's the way you gotta get 
Get it, make ya body rock 

You tryin', admit it 
But you just can't beat the feelin' inside 
You know it 
'Cause I can see it in your eyes 
You want me 
You smooth as a mother 
You're so undercover 
By the way that you was watchin' me 

Ooh, uh 
The way you look at me 
I'm feelin' you, uh 
I just can't help it 
Tryin' to keep it cool, uh 
I can feel it in the beat, uh 
When you do those things to me, uh 
Don't let nothin' stop you 
Move, ring the alarm 
The club is jumpin' now 
So get up

Ooh, I love the way you vibe with me 
Dance with me forever 
We can have a good time, follow me 
To the beat together 
You and me, one on one 
Breakin' it down 
You can walk away now 
We got to turn this place out 

Chamillionaire
It's the kid that stay ridin' big 
The one the police tried to catch ridin' dirty 
In the club before eleven o'clock 
Like I'm tryin' to catch it down kinda early 
Look, ya thick, her hair brown and curly 
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly 
City boys say she fine a pretty 
In the country, boys say she fine and 'purty' 
My pockets thick as green, it's curvy 
And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry 
If bein' fresh to death is a crime 
I think it's time for me to see the jury 

You know Chamillionaire stay on the grind 
A hustla like me is hard to find 
I ain't really impressed, yes 
Unless it's about some dollar signs 
Ain't really no need to call you fine 
I know you be hearin' that all the time 
I'm watchin' you do ya step, do ya step 
Yep, it's goin' down
