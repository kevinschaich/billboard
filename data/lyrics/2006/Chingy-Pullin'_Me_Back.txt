(feat. Tyrese)

(Chorus) 
Every time I try to leave 
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
Every time I try to go 
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that 
Everything gon be alright 
Every time I try to leave 
Something keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
It was meant to be 
You were meant for me 
So that means we gotta make it work 

(Verse 1) 
It was all good at first, 
Spendin money, goin shoppin 
Eatin at the finest restaurants 
And then from club hoppin 
She was right thurr with me bottle poppin livin that life 
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like 
We didn't have a worry in the world, got u diamonds got u pearls 
Cut can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls 
Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it 
You got a good nigga on the side, u betta run wit it, 
Even though I'm on tha road doin shows, 
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow 
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry 
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me 
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her 
May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her, 
(Uh) I thought i was your man 
Guess u ain't understand, 
N now I'm sittin herre, lookin crazy like 
Damn! 

(Chorus) 
Every time I try to leave 
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
Every time I try to go 
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that 
Everything gon be alright 
Every time I try to leave 
Something keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
It was meant to be, 
You were meant for me, 
So that means we gotta make it work 

(Verse 2) 
Walkin to house from hard work, my head hurts, 
Instead of arguin, can i have dinner with some dessert (uh uh) 
She talkin 'bout this phone number she found, 
Hey, give me time to put my bags down, 
She's straight up, clowned 
Before we end up fightin, let me leave, 
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need 
Now I'm wit the fellas ridin n drinkin 
She's blowin my two way up but I need some time for thinkin 
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin naaaw 
Give her some space and the next day I might call 
What should I do 
Look, let me ask ya'll 
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall 
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed 
But it happens some time 
It's either love it or give it up 
I thought I was your man 
Guess u ain't understand 
N now I'm sittin' herre lookin crazy like 
Damn! 

(Chorus) 
Every time I try to leave 
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
Every time I try to go 
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that 
Everything gon be alright 
Every time I try to leave 
Something keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
It was meant to be, 
You were meant for me, 
So that means we gotta make it work 

(JD:) Chingy holla at dem agian !! 

(Verse 3) 
Ta all the fellas know u feel me, if u eva had a woman, 
Good times led to bad times n u ain't see it coming, 
Try the best to make her happy, 
But it wasn't enough, 
Cuz mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff 
N i don't wanna have my head down 
Weak n stressed out 
As bad as it hurts i gotta move to the next round 
(Uh) I thought i was her man 
Guess she ain't understand 
N now she's sittin' hurr lookin crazy like 
Damn! 

(Chorus) 
Every time I try to leave 
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
Every time I try to go 
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that 
Everything gon be alright 
Every time I try to leave 
Something keeps pullin me back, me back 
Telling me I need u in my life 
It was meant to be, 
You were meant for me, 
So that means we gotta make it work
