Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
(Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you
(Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh, I scream for you
(Come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need from you
(Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

And all I need is you
(Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you
(Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry I'm fallin'

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
