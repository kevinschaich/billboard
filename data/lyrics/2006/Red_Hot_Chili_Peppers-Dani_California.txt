Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, whatcha gonna?"

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
