Struttin' into town like your slingin' a gun
Just a small town dude with a big city attitude
Honey are ya lookin' for some trouble tonight
Well alright
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight
Oh that's right
You think you'll knock me off my feet
'Til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is crying indian and I'm beggin' for more
So come on baby, come on baby
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for

If you can give it, I can take it
Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well you ain't so strong
Won't be long till your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive
That's right
You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back, cause I'm ready baby aim and fire
Baby there's no way you're gonna run tonight
Ooh that's right
Well you've had your way with love
But it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't tear your heart away
So Come on baby, come on baby
Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say

If you can give it, I can take it
Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

You think you'll knock me off my feet
'Til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is crying Indian and I'm beggin for more
So come on baby, come on baby
Come on baby, Come on

If you can give it, I can take it
Cause if this heart is gonna break
It's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count
And you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

I'm gonna shoot ya down, Jesse James
