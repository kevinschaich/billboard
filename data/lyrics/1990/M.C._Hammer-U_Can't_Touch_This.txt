You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)
You can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)
(You can't touch this)

My, my, my, my
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lord!"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell school is in, sucker (You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Making no sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer when you're talking 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the nineties to burn
The charts legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop! Hammer time!

Go with the flow it is said
If you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump

Bump, bump, bump
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You'll better get hyped boy 'cause you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop! Hammer time!

(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop! Hammer time!

Every time you see me
That Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever
Stop doing this?
With others makin' records
That just don't hit
I toured around the world
From London to The Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer!"
And the rest can go and play

(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Yo, get me outta here, you can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
