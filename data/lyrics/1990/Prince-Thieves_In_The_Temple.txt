Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There's thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Love, if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I should die if you're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Feel like I'm looking for my soul
Like a poor man looking for gold
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Voices from the sky say
Rely on your best friend to pull you through
Even if I wanted to
I couldn't really truly
Because my only friend is you

Ooh ooh ooh ooohh
Come on

They're thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart
Because me and you could've been a work of art
Thieves in the temple

Baby don't you know I'm holding on the best that I can
Love please help me be a better man
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight, in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple tonight (hurt me)

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
They're thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple ohhh
"You said you loved me!"
(Thieves in the temple)
"You said I was your man!"
(Thieves in the temple)
(Love come quick)
"But they were lies! Lies!"
(Love come in a hurry)
Thieves in the temple tonight
"Ahhhh!"
