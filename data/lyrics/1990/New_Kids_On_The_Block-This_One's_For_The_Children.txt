This a very serious message, so all of you...please listen.

There are some people living in this world,
They have no food to eat,
They have no place to go.

But we all are God's children,
We have to learn to love one another,
Just remember they could be us,
Remember we all are brothers.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
Show them there's a better way.

This one's for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

Many people are happy,
And many people are sad.
Some people have many things,
That others can only wish they had.

So for the sake of the children,
Show them love's the only way to go,
'Cause they're our tomorrow,
And people they've got to know.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
And show them there's a better way.

This ones for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

This one's, for the children
Only for the children
The children of the world
This one's, for the children
This one's, for the children

Many people are happy,
Many people are sad,
This one's for the children of the world
The children of the world.
