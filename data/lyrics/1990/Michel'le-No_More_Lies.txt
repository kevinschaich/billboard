Hello?
Hello? Hello?
'Course you're the only girl.
You're all I think about.
You're the only girl for me.
You're all I think about.
You're special.
You know I love you,
You know I love you.

You say you love me,
And I think that is true.
But every night my Papa tells me
I should watch you.
Now I say I trust you,
But I want you to know
I'm not a sucker;
Chill out-your nose is growing, Pinocchio.

So now I'm leaving,
And you know I tried.
All right, baby, no more lies.
Do-do-doo-ooh-ooh,
Do-do-doo-ooh-ooh,
Do-do-do-do-do-ooh-ooh.

You say no more lies,
And I'll try to understand.
But there's a little exaggeration
In almost every man.
Now I say I trust you,
But I want you to know
Want you to know
Sounds like you're cryin' wolf, babe-
I think it's time for me to go.

So now I'm leaving,
And you know I tried.
All right, baby, no more lies.
But you don't appreciate
The time I take
All right baby, no more lies.

Hello? You're the only girl for me
No more lies.
You're all I think about;
'Course you're the only girl;
You're special
