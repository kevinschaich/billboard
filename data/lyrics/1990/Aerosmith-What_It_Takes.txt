Oh yeah

There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing

So baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away

We used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go, yeah

Girl, before I met you
I was F-I-N-E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doin' time

Spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

Guitar

Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah yeah yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you were lyin' when you cried for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice, no no no
'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise

Ooh
I don't, I don't
I don't wanna wanna burn in paradise
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't wanna burn, I don't wanna burn
Now no, no no no, ahhh

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Ahh

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Ooh yeah
