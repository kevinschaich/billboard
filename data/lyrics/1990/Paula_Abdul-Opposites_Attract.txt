Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like T.V.
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together it just all works out

I take two steps forward
I take two steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

And you know it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

Who'd a-thought we could be lovers
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby I get obsessed

She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes, I like to smoke
Things in common, there just ain't a one
But when we get together we have nothin' but fun

Two steps forward
Two steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

And you know it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

You know it, baby
We come together
We come together

Baby ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter, 'cause we're perfectly matched

I take two steps forward
I take two steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

And you know it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

Two steps forward
Two steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

And you know it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

Two steps forward
Two steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

It ain't fiction
You know it's a fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

Two steps forward
Two steps back
Two steps back
'Cause opposites attract

We go together
We go together
Oppostites attract

Two steps forward
Two steps back
Two steps back
'Cause opposites attract

We go together
We go together
Oppostites attract
