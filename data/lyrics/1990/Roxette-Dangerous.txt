Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

You pack your bag,
You take control.
You're movin' into my heart
And into my soul.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won't be walking on thin ice
To get through the night.

Hey, where's your work?
What's your game?
I know your business,
Don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous.

You turn around,
So hot and dry.
You're hidin' under a halo,
Your mouth is alive.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I'm not attracted to gogo
Deeper tonight.

Hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business,
But I don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous,
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

Hey, hey, hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business,
But I don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous.

She's armed and she's extremely dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous,
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

Oh, oh oh, hey, where's your work?
Mmm, what's your game?
I don't know your name.
Hey, you!
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.
I don't know your name.
