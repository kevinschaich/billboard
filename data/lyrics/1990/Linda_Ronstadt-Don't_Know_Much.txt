Look at this face 
I know the years are showing
Look at this life 
I still don't know where it's going

I don't know much 
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

Look at these eyes 
They never see what matters
Look at these dreams 
So beaten and so battered...

I don't know much 
But I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

So many questions 
Still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through

And when I feel you near me
Sometimes I see so clearly
The only truth I'll ever know 
Is me and you...

Look at this man 
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul 
Still searching for salvation

I don't know much 
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

I don't know much 
But I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

I don't know much 
But I know I love you
That may be all there is 
To know

Woah-woah-ah..
