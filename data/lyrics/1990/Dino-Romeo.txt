I want the best
I won't settle for less
Since Cupid shot my heart
I'm stressed

The love I feel is real strong
I can't prolong
Drop the beat and let's do this

I can't believe the way
I fell in love with you, girl
You caught me by surprise

A dream come true
It was you
I didn't even know your name
Oh, no

Now you've got me thinking
Bout you every single day, girl
I can't get you off my mind

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And I'm not the same, no, no

Just like a fairytale
I would sail oceans blue
To get to you
Valentine, please be mine
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart

I like the way you give me
Your affection every night, girl
You really turn me on

It makes my day when you say
You're never gonna let me go
Oh, no

Now everything around me
Just reminds me more of you, girl
I miss you when you're gone

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And there's something
You should know
You should know, know, know

Just like a movie screen
A love scene of me and you
The things we do
Casanova, move over
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)

I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) no, no, no

Hello, fly girl
How you doing
It's Dr.Ice and Dino
With the love just for you

And hey, I'm coming
Right and exact
Gonna be your romeo
To state a fact

? to express
How I feel about you

Don't move slow
Just kinda go with the flow
And let your hair down low
For me, your Romeo

(CHORUS)

I'll be your Romeo
I really love you so
I'll never let you go
I really, really love you
