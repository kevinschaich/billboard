Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in, into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand, oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence
