Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you have got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
Baby

You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Whoah, baby you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it to you one more time, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end

I learned something about myself
(Last night)
Last night with you I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end

No

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby, yeah
I'll fight you to the end

I don't want to fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love.
