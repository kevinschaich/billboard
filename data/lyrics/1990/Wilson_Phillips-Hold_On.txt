I know this pain (I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (these chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind, mmm

Until then, baby, are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know things'll change?

If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (no, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (ooh)
Letting your worries pass you by (letting your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind? (no, no)

Someday, somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know things'll change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (oh, things'll go your way)

But you hold on for one more day
And ya break free, break from the chains

Someday, somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye (say goodbye)
