Lately I've been trying to figure out your mind 
And why condition me poor little me 
And why you have a change of heart turn it all around and then 
Try to put it on me poor little me 
Don't ya know I can make ya trip I can make things hard 
But baby I believe that you've still got a heart that's why 
I try to stop myself before I start 'cause I can make it tough 
I can make it rough but won't 

And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt 
Giving you a minute to try to work it all out 
And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt 
And I'll be giving you a minute to try to work it all out 

Baby work it all work it all out 
(work, work, work) 
Baby work it all work it all out 
(work, work, work) oooohh 

Baby how could you be hangin' out on a diamond queen 
Ain't you missin' me poor little me 
When you knew all the time that you could have been 
With your home girl lovin' and a 
Kissin' on sweet little me 

Don't you know if you wanna be a man you gotta work real hard 
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one then 
Nothin' in the world should make us part 
'Cause we can make it work if you take it with the hurt from the heart 

And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt 
Giving you a minute to try to work it all out 
And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt 
And I'll be giving you a minute to try to work it all out 

Baby work it all work it all out 
(work, work, work) 
Work it baby (work, work, work) 
Keep tryin' to work it all out 

I can make you trip but I choose not to 
Inside of you I think there's still good in you boy 
Don't gimmie no reason not to trust you 
Just take the benefit don't gimme no lip and I'll be sweet to you 
(1-2-3-4) Try to understand you right boy So you need some time (time) to 
work it out work it work it There's really no need to fuss and fight no 
All I want is for you to try and work it out (1-2-3-4) REPEAT CHORUS 

(I'll be giving) I wanna give it 
Giving you the benefit 
I wanna give it giving you the benefit 
(I'll be giving I wanna give it giving you the benefit 
I wanna give it giving you the benefit 
I'll be giving you a minute or two to try and work it out 
But don't you take too long baby
