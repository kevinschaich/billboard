I hear a wind
Whistling air
Whispering in my ear

Boy mercury shooting through every degree
Oh girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocking through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the air-strip to the sunset 
Yeah ride the arrow to the target
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Fly the great big sky see the great big sea
Kick through continents bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
