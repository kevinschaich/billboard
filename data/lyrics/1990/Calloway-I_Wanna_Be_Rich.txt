Cash cold that's what I need 
These bill collectors they ring my phone 
They bother me when I'm not at home 
Ain't go no time to be fooling round 
Feet touch the floors and I get on down, you see 

I want money lots and lots of money 
I want the pie in the sky 
I want money lots and lots of money 
So don't be asking me why 

I wanna be rich oh 
I wanna be rich 
I wanna be rich oh 
I wanna be rich 

I want my cake wanna eat it too 
I want the stars and the silver moon 
I spend my money on lottery 
My favourite number is 1 2 3, you see 

I want money lots and lots of money 
I want the pie in the sky 
I want money lots and lots of money 
So don't be asking me why 

Every way rich 
Love peace and happiness 
I want all the things that lovers do 
A pocketful of dreams come true 
Everything you can not find 
Want you by my side? 

That'll keep you satisfied and rich 
Here is what your gonna do 
Say oh I say uh uh 
Got to be baby 
I just wanna be rich 
I just wanna be, just wanna be 
'Cause baby 

I want money lots and lots of money 
I want the pie in the sky 
I want money lots and lots of money 
So don't be asking me why 

Be rich I wanna be rich 
I know what I mean baby 
Everyday and every way 
Play baby there is lots for everyone
