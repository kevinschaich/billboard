Call me a joker, call me a fool
Right at this moment I'm totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life

Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill

Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

No, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Out of the darkness, into the light
Either I'm wrong or perfectly right
