All the lonely nights I spend alone
Never 'round to love me, you're always gone,
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you

(You're a rebel now) Don't give a damn
(Always carrying on) With the gang
(I'm trying to tell you, boy) It's a mistake
(You won't realize) till it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Schemin', plannin' lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

(Don't you tell yourself) That it's okay
(Sick and tired of) All of your games
(And you want me to stay) Ah, better change
(Makes no sense to me) Your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life, hoo
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die

Man, I don't understand your ways
Livin' on the edge

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life, hoo
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies, fellas

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die (talkin' 'bout the man)
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die (sing it up)

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights (yeah, yeah)
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die (Don't, don't, don't you die)
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

Black cat
Living' on the
Heartbeat
Better watch your step
