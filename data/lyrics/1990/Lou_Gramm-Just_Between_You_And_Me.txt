Staring at each other with accusing eyes
Keep our voices low and don't act surprised
If the word gets out, yeah, that's all right
I know you're just looking for some sympathy
But listen, you don't know how it gets back to me
You're getting reckless, girl, but that's all right

Now don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
Then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me
You and me

I see telltale signs of a love in decline
Should be something to say but we don't take the time
And I don't understand, but that's all right
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart
Don't make an open book out of my private heart
You should know better now, but that's all right

Don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
Then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me
I said it's just between you and me

If we don't work this out, we won't recover
We'll lose this soulful love for one another
But with all I've heard and all I've seen
I'm still lost in your mystery

Again we're staring at each other with accusing eyes
Keep our voices low, don't act surprised
If the word gets out, yeah, that's all right

And don't you know that one cold word's gonna lead to another
And then we'll have nowhere to go

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
It's just between you and me

Even if heaven and earth collide tonight
We'll be all alone in a different light
Now, I don't care what the world can't see
When it's just between you and me
It's just between you and me
You and me

Heaven and earth
I don't understand
Ooh, you're getting reckless, girl
All alone
One cold, cold word
Could lead to another
Heaven and earth
All alone, all alone
Heaven and earth, oooh
