Better make tracks fast on the double
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble - Oh!

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude
Leads you on, then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her
In the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She gets you hot then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
'Cause she knows you'll always give her one more try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playin' to the crowd
But tell me, do you really like standin' in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie (that would be a lie)
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

Jump in
One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this here as a dis and a goodbye

She ain't worth it, even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry, 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you
(puttin' you) Puttin' you through

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
