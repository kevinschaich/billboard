intro
When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

chorus
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love everyday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

chorus

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

chorus

ad lib:
Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home
Hey yea
He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you
