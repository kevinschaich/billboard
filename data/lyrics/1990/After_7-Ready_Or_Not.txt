I'll give you the Sun
The Rain
The Moon
The Stars and The Mountains
I'll give you the world
And all that you wish for
And even more
Girl I love you more than you could know
And that's for sure
I'd climb the highest hill
Cross the widest sea
Nothin could discourage me
And I pray that you will be
Always there for me
Forever more

Chorus:
Ready or not
I'll give you everything
and more
All that I've got--it's yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for

I'll give you my heart
My soul
My time
My love is a fountain
I will be your earth
And all that you need for
and even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
My love is pure
I'll walk a thousand miles
Sail a thousand seas
Nothin will discourage me
And I pray that you will be
Always there for me
Forever more

Repeat Chorus 3x
