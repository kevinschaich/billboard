I'm sick and tired of being left at home
While the boys go out and leave us all alone, yeah
I wanna go out with my girlfriends and party all nite
And this time you won't change my mind
'Cause I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me

It's that girls nite out, women nite out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play
So don't wait up for me

You're stepping out, and we're leaving
All that troubles behind, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I've got the girls, and we've only got one thing
On our mind, where are we going tonite?

The time is right, so are you ready to party all nite?
And this time I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me

It's that girls nite out, women nite out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play
So don't wait up for me

I like to party, I'm outta here
Which the time has come for the boys to realize
That is our turn to have some fun and it's gonna be tonite

It's that girls nite out, women nite out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's that girls nite to play, women nite to play
So don't wait up for me
