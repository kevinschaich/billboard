With music by our side
To break the color lines
Let's work together
To improve our way of life

Join voices in protest
To social injustice
A generation full of courage
Come forth with me

People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation

This is the test
No struggle no progress
Lend a hand to help
Your brother do his best

Things are getting worse
We have to make them better
It's time to give a damn
Let's work together come on now
