My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you

Ohohoho, Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh, yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you

Ohohoho, Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo

So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you

Ohohoho, Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo

Ooohooohooo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Ohohoho, Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo
Ooohooohooohooo, Waterloo
