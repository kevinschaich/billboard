I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy

All around in my hometown
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of the deputy
For the life of a deputy, but I said

I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense
I shot the sheriff
And they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what? I don't know
But every time that I plant a seed
He said "Kill it before it grows"
He said "Kill it before it grows"

I said
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah
All of a sudden I see Sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down, I said

I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket falls to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out, I said

I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy
Oh no, oh no
I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot no deputy
Oh no
