You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says "hello, it's good to see you"
Anytime I turn around to find you there

It's this and so much more that make me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you have whatever is mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Loving you
