Uh...
Oh, baby
Oh, baby (Keep on)
Come on, baby (Keep on doin' it, right on)
Mmm, mmm, mmm (Right on doin' it)
You got it together (Baby, keep on)
Oh, you got it together, baby (Right on, keep on doin' it)
Not yet, baby, oh, not yet
Mmm, mmm (My-my baby, keep on)
I swear you got it together, baby (Keep on, keep on)

Whatever, whatever
Girl, I'll do
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through

I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand

Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too

'cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more

And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Whatever you want
Girl, you got
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it

You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dyin' day

I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill

'cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more

And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

I'm never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Oh, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
