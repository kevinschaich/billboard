These are the eyes that never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms that long to lock you inside
Every day and every night (do-do-do-do-do)

Girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right?

Whoa, show and tell, just a game I play
When I want to say I love you
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby

These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight (anywhere in sight)
And these are the lips that can't help calling your name
In the middle of the night (middle of the night)

Whoa, and here is the man who needs to know where you stand
Don't you know I've done all I can, so decide

Whoa, show and tell is just a game I play
When I want to say I love you (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby

Ah, and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right?

Ooh girl, show and tell, just a game I play
When I want to say, oh, I love you (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby

Oh, show and tell, just a game I play
When I want to say, oh, I love you (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
