Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better loking each day.
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I used to have a girlfriend
But she just couldn't compete
With all of these love starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet.
Well I prob'ly could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me.
Who cares, I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way,
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I guess you could say I'm a loner,
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud.
I could have lots of friends if I want to
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd.
Some folks say that I'm egotistical.
Hell, I don't even know what that means.
I guess it has something to do with the way that I
Fill out my skin tight blue jeans.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way,
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
We're doing the best that we can
