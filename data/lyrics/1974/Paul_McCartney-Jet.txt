I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were going to be marrying soon
And Jet
I thought the only lonely place was on the moon
 
Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?
Well how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?
And Jet
I thought the major was a lady sufragette
 
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me?
Ah, mater, much later
 
With the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet
I thought the major was a little lady suffragette
 
And Jet
You know I thought you was a little lady suffragette
 
A little lady, my little lady yes!
