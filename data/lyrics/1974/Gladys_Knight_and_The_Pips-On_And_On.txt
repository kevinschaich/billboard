Bet your life I'll be, yeah
A better woman, you see
All because you proved out to be
A better man for me

You build me up with so much affection
(You build me up with so much affection)
And you make me realize my needs
(And you make me realize my needs)
We seem to move in the right direction
(Seem to move in the right direction)
Makin' love, makin' love
(Makin' love, makin' love)
Oh, please

How can I
How can I show you how
I want, now, prove all love
But I'm so afraid
To take a part
Don't break my heart
The way so many lovers do

So good I feel
'Cause our love's for real
Having tons of fun
Since our love's begun

Huggin' and a-lovin'
On and on
Gettin' with the kissin'
On and on
Chills I feel whenever you're near
Stickin' like a glue
Keep on lovin' you

On and on
On and on
Keep on groovin'
On and on
We gotta go
Keep on movin'
Keep on groovin'
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
We gotta go

How can I break down
This sweet relation
(Yes, filled with love)
Keepin' our hearts together
With no temptation
Keepin' us lovin'
Keepin' us lovin'

Goin' on and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
We gotta go
On and on
Keep on movin'
On and on
Keep on groovin'
On and on
On and on
On and on
We go on and on

I wanna know
I know you feel like I do
That's why we got a love that's real
So let's keep on groovin' the way we do
Let's just keep on movin'
We're gonna make it through

Huggin' and a-lovin'
(Huggin' and a-lovin')
Gettin' with the kissin'

Gettin' with the kissin'
(Gettin' with the kissin')
Huggin' and a-lovin'
