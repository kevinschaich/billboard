So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat

Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place to harbor you and me

Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat

Up to now we sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Oh I need to have the strength that flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear, when love can see me through

Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion

To rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, ooh

Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self

Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
