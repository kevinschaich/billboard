Hmmm, hmmm
Yeah
Oh Baby, hmmm
Hang on in there, baby
(Give me love tonight)
Don't be afraid, baby, ooooh

You know we can't help but make it, ooh my love
You know we can't help but make it
Now that we've caressed a kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait till we reach that sweet moment of surrender
Oh we'll hear the thunder roar, feel the lightning strike
At a point we'll both decide to meet at the same time tonight

Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible

Don't be afraid baby, oooh no
Sweet virgin of the world
You know we can't help but make it
'Cos there's true love between us girl
Hmmm! so let us touch that cloud
That everyone dreams of
Oh! we're almost there darling truly making love

Hang on in there baby, please don't let me down
Please don't destroy this new joy

What's that now baby, what's that you say
Something's eating at you
And it's hard to get away (hard to get away)
Oh don't fight it baby just open up the door
'Cos that's the key to the freedom
That we've both been working for
Let it go baby, let it go darling, oooh
Right there, right there
Baby don't you move it don't you dare
Go baby let it go honey oh right there baby
Don't you move it anywhere

Give it a stand (x3) up now fashion
Give it a jump (x3) up
Give it a jam (x3) give it a pull
Give me a love (2) give me a little love

(Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling)
Hang on in there now
(I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible)
Hang on in there, darling
(Hang on in there baby)
Hang on in there baby
(Please don't let me down) hold it down
(Please don't destroy this new joy)
New joy (we've found)
New joy we've found
