As my life goes on, I believe
Somehow, something's changed
Something deep inside, ooh, a part of me

There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life, changing me

I've been searchin' so long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning, oh

Now I see myself as I am
Feeling very free
Life is everything, ooh, it's meant to be

When my days have come to an end
I will understand
What I left behind, part of me

I've been searchin' so long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning, woah, woah

Searching (don't you know I'm, oh yeah) for an answer
To the question, oh yeah, who am I
Baby (baby it's true), it's only natural
Good things in life take a long time
