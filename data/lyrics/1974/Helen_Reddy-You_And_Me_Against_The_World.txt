Tell me again, mommy

You and me against the world
Sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
When all the others turn their backs and walk away
You can count on me to stay

Remember when the circus came to town
And you were frightened by the clown
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for you 

And me against the world
Sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried
I always felt that God was on our side

And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world

And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world

I love you, mommy
I love you too, baby
