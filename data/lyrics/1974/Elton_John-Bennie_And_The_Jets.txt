Hey kids, shake it loose together 
The spotlight's hitting something 
That's been known to change the weather 
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around 
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound 

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet 
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets 
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful 
Oh, Bennie she's really keen 
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit 
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets 

Hey kids, plug into the faithless 
Maybe they're blinded 
But Bennie makes them ageless 
We shall survive
Let us take ourselves along 
Where we fight our parents out in the streets 
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet 
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets 
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful 
Oh Bennie, she's really keen 
She's got electric boots 
A mohair suit 
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet 
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets 
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful 
Oh Bennie, she's really keen 
She's got electric boots 
A mohair suit 
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, Jets, Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
