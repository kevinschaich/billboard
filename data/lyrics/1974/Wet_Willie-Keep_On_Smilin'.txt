Well you say you got the blues,
You got holes in both of your shoes, yeah-
You're feeling alone and confused,
You got to keep on smilin', just keep on smilin'

Yeah, you're- you're bout to go insane,
Cause your womans playing games,
And she says that you're to blame,
You try to keep on smilin',  just keep on smilin'

Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes, till the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes, and singin' this refrain

Singing in a honky tonk cafe,
Nobodys hearin' what you play, yeah-
They're too busy drinkin anyway,
You gotta keep on smilin', brother keep on smilin'

Say you found a piece of land
Gonna change from city boy to country man, yeah-
Try to build you're life with your hands
And just keep on smilin', keep on smilin'

Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes, till the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes, and singin' this refrain

You're just hangin out- in a local bar,
And you're wonderin'- who the hell you are
Are you a farmer - are you a star?

Smile on through the rain
Laugh all through the pain
Flow through to changes
Till the sun comes out again

Keep on smilin', smilin' - smilin', smilin'
Laughin, laughin- said laughin', laughin'
Keep on flowin', flowin', flowin'
Yeah
