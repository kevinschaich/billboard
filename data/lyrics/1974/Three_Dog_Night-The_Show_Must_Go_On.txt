Baby, although I chose this lonely life 
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now

Oh, I've been used, ooh, used
I've been a fool, oh, what a fool
I broke all the rules, oh, yeah
But I must let the show go on

Baby, there's an enormous crowd of people
They're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls of this theater
Let me out, let me out

Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted, wasted time
Walking on a wire, high wire
But I must let the show go on

Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time
Walking on a wire, high wire
But I must let the show go on

Baby, I wish you'd help me escape
Help me get away
Leave me outside my address
Far away from this masquerade

'Cause I've been blind, oh, so blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time
Walking on a wire, high wire
But I must let the show go
I must let the show go
I must let the show go on
