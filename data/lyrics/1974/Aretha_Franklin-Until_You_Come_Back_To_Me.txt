Though you don't call any more
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I wanna tell ya baby changes I've been goin' through
Missin' you - listen you
(Till you come back to me - that's what I'm gonna do)

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride (my pride)
Gonna beg ya to please - baby please see me
(Baby won't you see me)
I'm gonna walk out by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
Oh for ya baby
(Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do)

Baby for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (hear my plea)
I've got to make you see (gotta make you see)
That our love is dying (our love is dying)

Although your phone you ignore            
Somehow I must - somehow I must - how I must explain 
I'm gonna rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)

I'm gonna camp by your steps 
Until I get through to you
I've gotta the change your view, baby
(Till you come back to me - that's what I'm gonna do)

(Till you come back to me - that's what I'm gonna do)

(Till you come back to me - that's what I'm gonna do)

I'm gonna rap on your door (rap on it)
Tap on your win- (tap on it) - dow pane
Open up baby
I'm gonna rap on your door (rap on it)
Tap on your - tap on your (tap on it)
Tap on your - tap on your window pane
(Tap on your window pane)
I'm gonna rap on your door (rap on it)
Tap on your door (tap on it) window pane
Open up baby...
