Put your hands together
Na-na-na-na
Put your hands together
Everybody now
Put your hands together
Na-na-na-na
Let us pray

We've got to pray for all
The brothers under thine hand
Pray for all the sisters
That's doing the best she can
Let us pray that tomorrow
There'll be a better
Day to come, yeah

We got to put our forces together
Sing a song so loud, so fair
That the birds in the trees
Hum along with me
Sweet harmony

Then let it thunder
Let it lightning, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
'Cause we're gonna sing
Glory hallelujah so the
Whole wide world can hear

Come on, y'all, now
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
And let us pray

We got to pray for all the people
Who are sleeping in the street
Pray for all the people
Who don't have enough to eat
Let us pray that tomorrow
There'll be a better day to come
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We got to put our forces together
Sing a song so loud, so fair
That the birds in the trees
Hum along with me
Sweet harmony

Then let it thunder
Let it lightning, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
'Cause we're gonna sing
Glory hallelujah so the
Whole wide world can hear

Come on, come on
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
And let us pray

'Cause we're gonna sing sing
Glory, glory hallelujah
Right here, right now
I said we'll, we'll, we'll
We'll sing, singing
Glory, glory hallelujah
