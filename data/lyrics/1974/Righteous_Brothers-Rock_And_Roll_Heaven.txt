If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band Jimmy

Gave us rainbows and Janis
Took a piece of our hearts and Otis

Brought us all to the dock of a bay
Sing a song to light my fire, remember Jim
That way, they've all found another place, another place to play

If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band Jimmy

Remember bad bad Leroy Brown, hey Jimmy
Touched us with that song
Time won't change a friend we came to know and Bobby

Gave us Mack the Knife
Well look out, he's back in town
They'll all be there together
When they meet in one big show

If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band Jimmy

There's a spotlight waiting
No matter who you are 'cuz everybody's got a song to sing
Everyone's a star
(Everybody's got to be a star)

If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band Jimmy
