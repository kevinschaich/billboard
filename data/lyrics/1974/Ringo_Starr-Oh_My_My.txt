I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said, "Come on over"
I said, "Do I hafta"
My knees started shakin'
My wrists started achin'
Wwn my doctor said to me,

CHORUS
Oh my my, oh my my
Can you boogie, can you slide
Oh my my, Oh my my
You can boogie if you try
Oh my my, oh my my
It's guarateed to keeep you alive
