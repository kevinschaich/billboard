I've traveled far, the land and the sea
Beautiful places I happened to be
One little town I'll never forget
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia

There, like a dream, this wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light
A feeling divine swept over me there
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer

Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia

Now I am home, I'm happy to be
Telling of places I've traveled to see
One little town I'll never forget
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia

Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
