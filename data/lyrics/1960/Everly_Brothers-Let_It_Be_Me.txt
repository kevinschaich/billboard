I bless the day I found you 
I want to stay around you 
And so I beg you, let it be me 

Don't take this heaven from one 
If you must cling to someone 
Now and forever, let it be me 

Each time we meet love 
I find complete love 
Without your sweet love what would life be 

So never leave me lonely 
Tell me you love me only 
And that you'll always let it be me 

Each time we meet love 
I find complete love 
Without your sweet love what would life be 

So never leave me lonely 
Tell me you love me only 
And that you'll always---let--it—be--me
