My name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache is all that I know
Yeah lonely lonely blue boy is my name 

My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been raining the night I was born
Yeah lonely lonely blue boy is my name

Well I'm so.I'm so afraid of tomorrow
And so tired,so tired of today
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way

I'm writing this letter to someone unknown
So if you should find it and if you're alone
Well, lonely lonely blue boy is my name
Remember lonely,lonely blue boy is my name
