Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he  holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go

You cant say the words I want to hear
While  you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you
He'll have to go
