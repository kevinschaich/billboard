It's now or never, come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late 
It's now or never, my love won't wait

When I first saw you with your smile so tender 
My heart was captured, my soul surrendered 
I spent a lifetime waiting for the right time 
Now that you're near, the time is here, at last

It's now or never, come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never, my love won't wait

Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean 
If we lost true love and sweet devotion 
Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me 
For who knows when we'll meet again this way 

It's now or never, come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never, my love won't wait

It's now or never, my love won't wait
It's now or never, my love won't wait

It's now or never, my love won't wait
