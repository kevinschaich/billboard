I told you, baby, how I feel
One word can close this deal
Baby, be my queen of hearts
Please gimme that love you've got
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio

Maybe I'm just wastin' time
Can't get you off my mind
You could make me feel so good
I know you could if you only would
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio

I wrote you a six-page letter
I called you on the phone
But you started talkin' 'bout the weather
Kiddio, don'tcha know that's wrong?

I can't stand this playin' 'round
Help me up, don't let me down
Kiss me baby, tell me so
If you love me, let me know
a-won'tcha say yes? don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio

I wrote you a six-page letter
I even called you on the phone
But you started talkin' 'bout the weather
Kiddio, don'tcha know that's wrong?

I can't stand this playin' 'round
Help me up, don't let me down
a-kiss me baby, tell me so
If you love me, let me know
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio

Make me feel so-uh-oh oh good , so, so good, kiddio
