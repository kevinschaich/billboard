Anytime you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
You don't have to be blue
Here's all you gotta do

Call me on the telephone
Tell me that you're all alone
And I'll come a runnin' to you
Baby thats all you gotta do

All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can

I'll love and squeeze you uh huh huh
I'll try to please you
Cause baby I want you to be my lovin' man

I've been waiting for the chance
Needing you to start a romance
And if you feel the same way too
Here's all you gotta do

Tell me just a how you feel
Tell me that your love is real
And I'll give my heart to you
Baby thats all you gotta do

All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can

I'll love and squeeze you uh huh huh
I'll try to please you
Cause baby I want you to be my lovin' man

I've been waiting for the chance
Needing you to start a romance
And if you feel the same way too
Here's all you gotta do

Tell me just a how you feel
Tell me that your love is real
And I'll give my heart to you
Baby thats all you gotta do
