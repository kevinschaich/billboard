(Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
(It's finger pop poppin' time)
(Finger poppin', poppin' time)
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

(Here comes May and here comes Sue)
(Here come Johnny and Bobby too)
(It's finger pop poppin' time)
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

(Here comes May and here comes Sue)
(Here come Johnny and Bobby too)
(It's finger pop poppin' time)
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

(Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
(It's finger pop poppin' time)
(Finger poppin', poppin' time)
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign
