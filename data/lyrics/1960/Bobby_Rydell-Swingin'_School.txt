Chicks, kicks, cats, cool, yeah school! 

Yeah, yeah, yeah I go a swingin' school 
Where the chicks are kicks and the cats are cool. 
Well we dance the greatest and we dress the latest 
Wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school. 

Ah, Bobby Ah! Uh huh! Everythings cool, thats cool 
We're glad you go to a swingin' school. 

My little chick is my heart's desire 
Well the way we kiss it puts the school on fire. 

Ah chicks, kicks, cats, cool, yeah school! 
Yeah yeah yeah wail! 

After school we have to rendezvous 

Gonna plan all the things that we're gonna do. 
Trade bookin' for cookin' and I'll quit my lookin' 
When our days at the school are through. 

Ah, Bobby Ah! Ah hah! Everythings cool, thats cool 
We're glad you go to a swingin' school. 

We live and love by the golden rule 
We're gonna settle down at a swingin' school. 
Well have a house and car, a swimmin' pool 
Wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school. 

I said a wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school.
