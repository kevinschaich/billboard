Well I'm making alright (Well I'm making alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends

Since you left me (since you left me)
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends

You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (ooh-wah) would never die (ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try

Well I'm making alright (Well I'm making alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends

You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (ooh-wah) would never die (ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try

Well I'm making alright (Well I'm making alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends

Oh, those lonely weekends
