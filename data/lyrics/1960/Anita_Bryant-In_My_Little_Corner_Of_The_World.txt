Oh, come along with me
To my little corner of the world
And dream a little dream
In my little corner of the world

Tonight, my love
We'll share a sweet embrace
We'll soon forget
There's any other place

And if you care to stay
In my little corner of the world
Then we can hide away
In my little corner of the world

I always knew
I'd find someone like you
So welcome to
My little corner of the world

And if you care to stay
In my little corner of the world
Then we can hide away
In my little corner of the world

I always knew
I'd find someone like you
So welcome to
My little corner of the world
