When the evening shadows fall
And the lovely day is through
Then with longing I recall
The years I spent with you

Mama, I miss the days
When you were near to guide me
Mama, those happy days
When you were here beside me

Safe in the glow of your love
Sent from the heavens above
Nothing can ever replace
The warmth of your tender embrace

Oh, Mama, until the day
That we're together once more
I'll live in these memories
Until the day that we're together once more
