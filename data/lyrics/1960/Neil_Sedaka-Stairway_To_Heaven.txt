Climb up
Way up high
Climb up
Way up high
Climb up
Way up high

Well-a, well-a, well-a, heavenly angel
I want you for my girl
When I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
I knew that you were out of this world

I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

Well-a, well-a, well-a, over the rainbow
That's where I'm gonna climb
Way up high where the bluebirds fly
I'm gonna love you all of the time

I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

Well-a, well-a, well-a, I gotta be going
Gonna leave the world behind
Every day in a heavenly way
You're gonna drive me outta my mind

I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

Climb up
Way up high
Climb up
Way up high
Climb up
Way up high
Climb up
Way up high
