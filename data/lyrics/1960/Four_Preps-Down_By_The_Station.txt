Down by the station early in the morning
Met a little girl about as cute as she could be
I turned on my charms and told her that I loved her
I said that she would always be the number one for me
She'd always be my number one girl
I said there'd be no number two or three

Down in the malt shop shortly thereafter
Met another girl about as cute as she could be
I looked for number one and when I didn't see her
I told number two she was the only girl for me

Went to the drug store and nearly lost my life
There I saw my girlfriends, one and two
Standing there together, I knew I was in trouble
But I'm a clever guy I knew what to do

I went on down by the station early in the morning
I was wooing women as cute as they could be
But then I saw another girl lookin kinda pretty
I said I'm through with one and two
I love you number three
I said I love you number three
And here's what she said to me

Just head on down by the station early in the morning
Catch yourself a trolley car that goes into the sea
I want a love that's true sir, not a love like you sir
You weren't true to one and two
You won't be true to me

Down by the station early in the morning
See the little puffer-bellies all in a row
See the station master pull the little handle
Chug, chug, woo, woo, off they go
