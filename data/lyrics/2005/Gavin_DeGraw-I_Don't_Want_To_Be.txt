I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other 
Than a specialist's son

I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't want to be 
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do 
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters 
Everywhere I turn

I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't want to be 
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do 
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't want to be 
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do 
Is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms

Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me
I don't want to be
