Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt

You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are you stick around
And I just don't know why

If I was yo man, baby you
Never worry 'bout, what I do
I'll be coming home, back to you
Every night doin' you right

You're the type of woman, deserves good thangs
Fist full of diamonds, handful of rings
Baby you're a star
I just want to show you you are

You should let me love you 
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection 
Make me your selection 
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, yeah
Listen

Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts 
You're a dime plus ninety-nine
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth 

Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control baby you know 

If I was yo man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'll be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right

If I was yo man, baby you
Never worry 'bout, what I do
I'll be coming home, back to you
Every night doin' you right

You're the type of woman, deserves good thangs
Fist full of diamonds, handful of rings
Baby you're a star
I just want to show you you are

You should let me love you 
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection 
Make me your selection 
Show you the way love's supposed to be 

Baby you should let me

You deserve better girl, you know you deserve better
We should be together girl, baby
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby, you should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
That good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be, hey

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Let me love you
That's all you need, baby
