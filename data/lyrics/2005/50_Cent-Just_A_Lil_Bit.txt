Damn baby all I need is a li'l bit
A li'l bit of this, a li'l bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear this shit
Drop it like its hot,
get to workin' that back,
Go shake that thang,
Yeah work that thang
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang,
I wanna touch that thang
Can you make it go round and round
I step up in the club, I'm like who you with
G-Unit in the house, yeah thats my clique
Yeah Im young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dance floor, a nigga doin' old moves
I dont give a fuck, I do what I wanna do
I hit your ass up, boy I done warned you
Better listen, when I talk, nigga don't trip
Yo heat in the car, mine's in this bitch
I ain't tryna beef, Im tryna get my drink on
Got my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar till its time to go
Then I'ma get shorty here and I'ma let her know


All a nigga really need is a li'l bit
Not a lot baby girl just a li'l bit
We can head to the crib in a li'l bit
I can show ya how I live in a li'l bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a li'l bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a li'l bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a li'l bit
Get to lickin' and -- a li'l bit


This is 50, comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though, cause I switched the flow
Eyes a li'l low, cause I twist the dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the "O"s
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get ya bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now captain come on and save a hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart, all the time mayn
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, that's without a doubt
And shorty shake that thang like a pro mayn
She back it up on me I'm like "oh mayn!"
I get close enough to her so I know she can hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear


All a nigga really need is a li'l bit
Not a lot baby girl just a li'l bit
We can head to the crib in a li'l bit
I can show ya how I live in a li'l bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a li'l bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a li'l bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a li'l bit
Get to lickin' and -- a li'l bit


Baby you got me feelin' right (ya heard me)
My mama gone, you can spend the night (ya heard me)
I ain't playin', I'm tryna fuck tonight (ya heard me)
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon


All a nigga really need is a li'l bit
Not a lot baby girl just a li'l bit
We can head to the crib in a li'l bit
I can show ya how I live in a li'l bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a li'l bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down a li'l bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a li'l bit
Get to lickin' and -- a li'l bit
