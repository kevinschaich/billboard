Yeah

Well, it's a long way from Star,Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo! 

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
Still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around this world 
Thats alright
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi---- girl

Mississippi girl! 
Oh,oh 
Mississippi girl!
 
yeah, yeah, oh
oh oh oh oh oh 
Mississippi girl! 
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...
