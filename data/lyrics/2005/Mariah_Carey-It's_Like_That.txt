I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy I know you're watching me
So what's it gonna be
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy you got me inspired
Baby come and get it 
If you're really feeling me

Cause it's my night
No stress no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)

You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby come and get it
Let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let
Nobody's drama bother me

Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)

Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
Cause me and my girls
On the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all (that y'all)
