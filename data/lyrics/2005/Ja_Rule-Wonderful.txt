R. Kelly, (Ashanti):
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Ja Rule:
Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin ain't easy
Trust me I know 
When gangstas and hos 
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
Cuz this is how I'm livin and yall women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
It's the power of the p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggaz wonderin it ain't just i
Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-c

R. Kelly:
How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status?
Player status?
Pimps that get 
Ya boy half rich fore we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull them in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
Im at the top of the world and lifes a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-i-a
Shut the game down so the bustas cant play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been thru
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

Ja Rule:
I wonder why love is about money
And why wou wanna take it all from me
Honey
My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Yall bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil change
Girl im pitchin quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New Benzes new Porsches
New cases new lawyers 
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggaz couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggaz don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that im still here
Thought I was gone but im still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there
