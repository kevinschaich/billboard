1, 2, 3, Let's go!

(Chorus)
'Little mama show me how you move it
Go head-putcha back into it
Do your thing like there ain't nothin' to it
Shake, shh shh shake that ass girl
'Little mama show me how you move it
Go head-putcha back into it
Do your thing like there ain't nothin' to it
Shake, shh shh shake that ass girl

Go, Go, Go, 50 in the house, bounce
Y'all already know what I'm about
Tha flow sounds sick over Dre' drums nigga
I ain't stupid, I see Doc then my dope come quicker
Whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves is so erotic, but watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here, front in here, we'll thump in here
Oooohh
I'm so gutta, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good?
Outside the benz on Dubs
I'm in the club wit the snubs
don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Uuuhhh

(Chorus)

Let's party, everybody stand up
Everybody put ya hands up
Let's party, everybody bounce with me
Sip champagne, and burn a little greenery
This hot
Disco Hell, let's go
You are now rockin with a pro
I get told to flip dough to get more, fo sho'
Get my drink on then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance all I do is this
It's the same 2-step with a little' twist
Listen pimpin' I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy, I teach how to do this shit
You mix a lil' criss with a little Don Perignon
And a little' Hennessy, you know we 'finna carry on
Hollerin' at this bitch in da club tryin' to get right
we gonna be up in this bitch 'til we break daylight

(Chorus)

You see me shinin', lit up with diamonds uz I stay grindin' (Uh-huh)
Homie you can catch me swoopin Bentley coupe switchin lanes (Ha Ha)
You see me rollin, you know I'm holdin, I'm about my paper (yeah)
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin', I'll embed it in ya brain, I'm off the chain (G-Unit!)
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, ok let's go

(Chorus)
