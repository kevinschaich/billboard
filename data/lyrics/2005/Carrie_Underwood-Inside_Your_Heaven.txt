I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around

I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
(Take me to that place you cry from)
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
