Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dyin' to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, and break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet,
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up, how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

And drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with the bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself) (Down, down in an earlier round)
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin' (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet, (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're goin' down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin' (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet, (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
