(feat. Akon)

(Akon)
Convict
Akon and Young Jeezy
Tryin' to take it easy
Only way to go
And So... (Lets Get It!)

(Chorus - Akon)
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop now
Cause I'm a rida (Yeah)
I'm just a Soul Survivor (Yeah)

Cause er'body know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped now
If you a rida (Yeah)
Or just a Soul Survivor (Yeah)

(Verse 1 - Young Jeezy)
(Let's get it) I can't sleep--we livin' in Hell (Yeah)
First they, give us the work then they throw us in jail (Ayy)
Road trip ya--I'm trafficing in the white
Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who Me?? I'm a Soul Survivor
Ask about 'em in the street, the boy Jeezy a rida (Jeezy a rida)
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah life sucks (Ha Ha)
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ayy)

(Chorus)

(Verse 2 - Young Jeezy)
Another day, another dolla (dolla)-same block, same nigga, same part, same green
I guess we got the same dreams (Ayy)
Or is it the same nightmares (nightmares)
We let the Thugs do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggaz don't budge
When Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)
I'm knee deep in the game
So when it's time to read up, I'm knee deep in the 'caine (Damn)
Real talk, Look, I'm tellin' you mayne (tellin' you mayne)
If you get jammed up don't mention my name
Forgive me Lord--I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggaz starvin', they got appitites (Ayy)
And this is er'day, it never gets old (Old)
Thought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code (Yeah)
This ain't a rap song, nigga this is my life (this is my life)
And if the hood was a battlefield then I'd earn stripes (Yeah)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3 - Young Jeezy)
Gotta watch your every move 'cuz them eyes be on you (eyes be on you)
Gotta drive real cool when them pi's be on you (pi's be on you)
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)
Them alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ayy)
(Lock Downs) They lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages
I ain't cheat--played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
(Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah)
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try)
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ayy)

(Bridge - Akon)
Cause if you lookin' for me you you can find me
On the block disobeyin' the law
Real G--thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now

(Chorus x2)
