Ladies and gentlemen (ladies and gentlemen, ooowee)
This is a Jazze Phizzle Productshizzle (Jazze Phizzle)
Missy (Missy)
The princess is here (Ooowee) (She's here)
Ciara! (This beat is)

Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic, this beat flows right through my chest
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party, grab somebody
Work your body, work your body, let me see you one, two, step (Here we go)

Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see ya, one, two, step, I love it when ya, one, two, step
Everybody, one, two, step, we about to get it on (This beat is)

Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it (Jazze made it)
So retarded, top-charted, ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and, yes, I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it

No, I can't control myself
Now let me do my one, two, step (Come on!)

Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see ya, one, two, step, I love it when ya, one, two, step
Everybody, one, two, step, we about to get it on (This beat is)

(We gon' drop the beat like this, ooowee)

It don't matter to me, we can dance slow (Ladies and gentlemen!)
Which ever way the beat drop, our bodies will go (I like this)
So swing it over here, Mr. DJ (Hey, hey)
And we will, we will rock you (Oh yeah)

It don't matter to me, we can dance slow (Dance slow yeah, yeah)
Which ever way the beat drop, our bodies will go (Hey, hey)
So swing over here, Mr. DJ (Ladies and gentlemen)
And we will, we will rock you

(I shake it like jello, make the boys say 'Hello'
'Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's
But they ain't got nothing on me)

(Because I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophisticated fun
I eat fillet mignon and I'm nice and young 
Best believe I'm number one) (Oooh!)

Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see ya, one, two, step, I love it when ya, one, two, step
Everybody, one, two, step, we about to get it on (This beat is)

Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see ya, one, two, step, I love it when ya, one, two, step
Everybody, one, two, step, we about to get it on
