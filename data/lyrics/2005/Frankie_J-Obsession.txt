(Check check ...this happened for real ...Baby Bash..ya.. Frankie J.... obsession)

Well it's early in the morning 
And my heart is feelin' lonely
Just thinkin' about you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it 
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right 
I'm tossin turnin' in my bed
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep 
Thinkin about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my heart
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm tryin' to make this right
I don't know what to do 
I'm going out of my mind 
So baby if you let me 
Kick it with you then we'll maybe
we could ride together
We could do this all night  
Now I don't care if you've got a man 
Baby I wish you'd understand 
Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep 
Thinkin about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feelin' hopeless at home
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feelin' (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion ( It's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart

(ooh)I love the way you freak it like that
(ooh)I love the way you freak it like that
(ooh)I love the way you freak it like that 
It's an obsession

Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin surene
Wear my candy your my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up wait a minute 
Baby you so damn independent 
Lovin' everything you're representing
Got alot of money and I love to spend it
And that's what's up 
And I dont care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen 
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cause momma know how I do
We gone rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong (what am I doin wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?

Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feelin' (then what am I feelin')
What am I doin wrong (what am I doin so wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart
** Amor **
