I'm the kinda brotha
Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life I hid love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out why I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me, yeah

My Momma told me
"Be careful who you do, 'cause karma comes back around"
Same ol' song, na
But I was so sure that it wouldn't happen to me
'Cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style
And I can't figure it out but I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold

I'm so
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me

And I think I like it baby
Oh no, oh no
Oh, yeah uh, oh no, ohh
This girl was mean
She really turned me out
Yeah, yeah, yeah sugar
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style
Oh, I'm so

Caught up
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losing control this girl's got a hold

I'm so
Caught up
I'm so
Caught up
I don't know what it is but it seems she's got me twisted
Caught up
Really feelin' it
Caught up
I'm losin' control this girl's got a hold on me
