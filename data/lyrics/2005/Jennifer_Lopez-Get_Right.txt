You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt, you play it real cool homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Trippin', a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

In my heart, in my heart
In my heart, in my heart

Your lips, talking about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

So much we got to say
But so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand
I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
