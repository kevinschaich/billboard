Ludacris
Sing it hoes,
All over the world baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with ya'll
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine
But I'ma start at home, when I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to her and I'm like (ugh)
Hey girl how ya doin' you are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, hey
See I'm the man of this town, and I hope you wouldn't mind
If I showed you around, so when you go to certain places
You'll be thinkin' of me, we got people to meet and many places to see, hey
I'm really diggin' ya lips, but be careful
Where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty heads pausin' so fast, hey
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes

Bobby Valentino
Oh yeah

Ludacris
You hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
'Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D
I'm takin you places you only see on T.V.
Tryna show ya that livin is trife
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the autobahn swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you wit me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin sure I don't miss the homecomin at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see, so if
Yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Heyy

Bobby Valentino
Oh yeah
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world

Ludacris
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin hand
Grenades, outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardigra all the women tryna show me they chest, hey
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rap wit no fans
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold til I went to Canada
And saw some beautiful hoes, now I hit the caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh), Oh
Yet and still you would'nt believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
Ain't no need of even askin brah
The best women are reside in Africa, and that's real

Bobby Valentino
Oh yeah
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world

Pimpin pimpin pimpin, ladies and gentlemen as we ride out,
Could we have all the real pimps,
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air,
Now ladies look around wit me, lets see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin, no
If you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, put yo hands down,
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please put your hands down, now look up at the pinky fingers
That are still in the air, if you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands and lotion three quarters of his body
Please say put yo hands down, if yo spinnin rims
Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin,
If you are dancin on the dancefloor and you look to
Yo left and yo right and you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin, if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
Put your hands down, now look down, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg
One time ok, you see the nigga wit the white socks not pimpin'!
Sorry unless you tryna do the Beat It entorauge,
If your shoes have a buckle on, your not pimpin
