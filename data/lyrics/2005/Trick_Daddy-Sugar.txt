(Intro ' Trick Daddy and Cee-Lo)
Uh huh yeah
Yeah hah
Oh man I got a sweet tooth, can you dig it
After this one you gunna need a root canal
Hehe
I love sugar, oh man
This one for all the nice, clean, decent women
Lay it on me girl
Pay close attention

Chorus 
(Cee-Lo)
She put that sugar, (oooh) on my tongue (oooh)
Shes gonna, (oooh) gimme gimme some (oooh)
She put it right there on my tongue (sweet sweet, lover lover)
Ohh she put it right there on my tongue (she turns me on, like no other)

(Trick Daddy)
Gimme some of your butter pecan
And put it right there, on the tip of my tongue
Hold it, right chyea, cause baby, if I bite ya I bet ya like it!
Fresh finale is a helluva fate for me
Strawberries two cherries and whipped cream
The best dreams are the wet dreams
The rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Orderely I speak the truth
Cause the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe they the best for eatin
All southern pores be cravin for 
an old slice of pie after they main course
What they game for, I came for
I gotta thang for you that I came for

Chorus 2x

(Ludacris)
Put that sugar on my tongue tongue
Yippie yippie yum yum
Goodie goodie gum drop, put me in a tongue lock 
did it til my body went numb numb
laid her on her back back
turn around gave her bottom a smack smack
shes the woman from the block with the best of beat
but I wont stop til im pullin out tracks tracks
it was lust at first sight
and she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
and my size was just right
plus she wanted a man with a little security
said I been around the world twice
and my name ring bells from Atlanta to sicily
cause she wanted it all night
put the bubbles in the tub and ludacris and me

Chorus 2x

(Trick Daddy)
Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious, and so damn edible
All I need is some honey and syrup
And a little butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Well pour lime and some grape kool-aid
Im gunna call you caramel
Cause im bout to go coo-coo to test your cocoa puffs
One more I feel ya up, milk butter your colon up
Supper time and I dont hold me up
Im bout to choke this up before I slow it up
Honey you look like a hundred
Eat strawberries with a whipped cream filling
Top baller with the peach condom
But a (who who) might outta do me betta

Chorus 2x
