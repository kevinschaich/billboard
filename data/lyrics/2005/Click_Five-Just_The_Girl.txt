She’s cold and she’s cruel
But she knows what she’s doing
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She’s the one I’m after

‘Cause she’s bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can’t help myself
I don’t want anyone else
She’s a mystery
She’s too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I’m looking for

She can’t keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do?
I’d do anything for her

‘Cause she’s bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can’t help myself
I don’t want anyone else
She’s a mystery
She’s too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She’s just the girl I’m looking for

The way she sees it’s me
On her caller I.D.
She won’t pick up the phone
She’d rather be alone
But I can’t give up just yet
‘Cause every word she’s ever said
Is still ringing in my head
Still ringing in my head

She’s cold and she’s cruel
But she knows what she’s doing
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

‘Cause she’s bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can’t help myself
I don’t want anyone else
She’s a mystery
She’s too much for me
But I keep coming back for more

‘Cause she’s bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can’t help myself
I don’t want anyone else
She’s a mystery
She’s too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
Oh, I keep coming back for more
She’s just the girl I’m looking for
Just the girl I’m looking for

I’m looking for
I’m looking for
I’m looking for
Just the girl I’m looking for
