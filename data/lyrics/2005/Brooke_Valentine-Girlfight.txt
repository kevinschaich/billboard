Sending this out to all the ladies that got beef with another bitch
Uh huh, just walk to that bitch and tell her, whatcha' tell her?

All around town making me stress,
I need to get this off my chest
And if her friend want some then she'll be next

Y'all walk around looking all frustrated
Want some plex come on let's make it
Ya acting real hard but I know ya fakin'

Really don't know why you talk this shit
You about to catch one right in the lip 
It's about to be a what? Girlfight!

And if you try to call yo cousin and nem

Oh I know you don't want me to split ya dome
Girl you makin me really mad...
Oh I know you don't want me to split ya dome
I'm about to bruise ya face and it's sad...

(Big Boi)
Oh snap, these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor now they preparing to scrap
They takin out their scrunchies and pullin off their press-ons
The one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is another woman
Someone please call securty, these girls too perty, 
To get down to the nitty titty
I mean the nitty gritty
I mean her titties pretty
I'm trippin being silly willy, man don't let them hoes fight

(Chorus)
It's about to be a what? Girlfight!
We bout to throw dem bows
We bout to swing dem thangs 
We bout to throw dem bows

It's about to be a what? Girlfight!

Don't act like you don't know
We right outside yo door
See you peekin' out the window
I know you ain't talking noise no more
Don't act like you don't know
We right outside yo door
See you peekin' out the window
I know you ain't talking noise no more
Bitch come outside

(Outro)
(Subliminal!)
Don't act like you don't see me
It's about to be a...Girlfight
