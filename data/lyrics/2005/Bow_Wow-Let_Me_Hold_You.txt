Come through here some sweets in it

Ya life girl, ya need me in it

I'm determined to win it

I know what you need

I know how to make it tight

Everything will be alright if you*



I introduce you to my world

Introduce you to the better side of life

That you ain't been seeing girl

Ima show ya where its happenin

All you gotta do is be wit it and



Down, like a real man's supposed to

I never woulda approached you

If I ain't have intentions of doing good

See dude you with is so fool

To me girl, you're so cool

And all I'm asking you to do



Down, like a best friend

Two homies in a gang

When you cry, I wanna feel your pain

No secrets, no games

Call me psychic, never playin

Keep ya happy, that's my aim

And all you gotta do girl is*











In my arms in my mind

All the time, I wanna

Keep ya right by my side

Till I die, I'm gonna

Hold you down

And make sure everything is right with you

You can never go wrong if you let me hold you down



Down like a real friend's supposed to

Try to show you the life that somebody like you should be living

Oh baby baby, you never go wrong if you







I'ma keep you up on what poppin

And shake you fresh to death

We hit the mall

We gon ball till there's no more left

I know you ain't used to it

But you gon get used to it

Cuz that's the only way I'm gonna do it now let me



All the homies think I'm trippin cuz I got you a pair

See they just mad cuz they ain't get you, they ain't get you

And girl ya so fine and I will do whatever in no time



No shine, Is what you comin with but I'ma change all that

Rearrange that, Put you in the Range all black

With the rims that match, phone attached, TV's in the back

How you gon say no to that ma?



Niggaz look at me, like man here you go

Really bout to bust the door

Hey nobody there before

So why you is you so cold?

Like a crack addict stuck in rehab
