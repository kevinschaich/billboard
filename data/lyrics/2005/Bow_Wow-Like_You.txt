I ain't ever had nobody show me all the things

That you done showed me

In a special way I feel when you hold me

We gon' always be together baby

That is what you told and

I believe it cause I ain't never had

Nobody do me like you





Now I done been with different kind of girls

So like I done seen them all

But ain't none of them at all (like you)

And I done seen the best of the best

Baby, still I ain't impressed cause

Ain't none of them at all (like you)

If you know how I feel when I chill

Look, if I'm seen with a girl

Then she gotta be just (like you)

And baby thats the way I feel

And I ain't got no choice

But for me to keep it real

Cause when we first got together

Starting hanging out you was skeptical at first

Had to figure out if

I was the kind of guy that

Would try to dog you out but

I ain't that kind of guy you try to make me out

You found out when you turned to my baby

I showed them other brothers

How to treat a lady

I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes

And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady

Cause baby you know









And everytime I think about you I smile

When you ride, when you call, when you come around

Your love is amazing to me

I can't wait till I see you (I wanna be with you again)

And everytime your out on the road (I'll make a trip)

And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)

That I'm your main chick

Who got that game chick

One in the same chick

The one you can hang with









Ok we hit the mall, pop tags

Spend a few G's (Cheesin')

Hit the runway to a new season

It ain't nothing

Spoil the one I care for

Feel like I ain't doin' enough

That's when I shape off

I give you this, give you that

What chu need love

You know I got it

Holla at me if you need love

In affection cause I'll be your protection

Kind of hard job but I'll do till perfection

And you can tell that I ain't tryin' to let you go

I get with you when I can

So thats how I let you know

And you be trippin' cause sometimes I gotta go

But chu the first one

I hollared to right after my show

Hey now I was trippin' in a sense

I was tense but my body's lose around you

But I'ma do without you

I gotta get it together, say whateva

Since I met you my life seems so better
