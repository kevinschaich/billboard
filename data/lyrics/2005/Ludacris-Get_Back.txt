Eet eet WHOOP WHOOP!! why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit
That I ain't trying to hear
Get back mothafucker You don't know me like that

Eet eet WHOOP WHOOP!! I ain't playing around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back mothafucker! You don't know me like that
(Get back mothafucker!! You don't know me like that!!)

WHOO!! S-s-so c'mon c'mon
DON'T ... get swung on, swung on
It's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs
Family off the street! made my homies put the baggies back
Still stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)
And dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
Cause I'll prove it! scratch off the music
Like hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!

I came (I came) I saw (I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)

See I caught 'em wit a right hook, caught 'em wit a jab
Caught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your fame
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

You want WHAT wit me?

GET DOWN! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you

Man! Cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning wit a story to tell
I know it's been a lil while since I been out the house
But now I'm here, you wanna stand around
Running your mouth?
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so whats up
Don't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!
