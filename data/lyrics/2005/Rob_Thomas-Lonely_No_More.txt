Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?

Can you swear to me
That you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby

Well, I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list?

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

Now it's hard for me
When my heart still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me

And it's harmony
Girl what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything
Just to get you back again
Why can't we just try

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list?

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?

And what if it was paradise?
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life
To find some way to stand beside you?

Well, I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list?

I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't, I don't, I know, I know
I don't want to be lonely anymore
