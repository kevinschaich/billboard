You left me here on your way to paradise
And you pulled the rug right out from under my life
I know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night
'Cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Lord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago
When I realized, the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soul

This lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere
It don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care
Don't let the screen door hit you on your way out
Don't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground

I'd just like to know, do you love him or just makin' time
By filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lime
You'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night
With your eyes all a-mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)
Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)
Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Mist in your eyes from a distant fire)
Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a dis
A distant fire
