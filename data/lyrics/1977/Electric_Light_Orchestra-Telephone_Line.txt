Hello, how are you?
Have you been all right
Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?
That's what I'd say
I'd tell you everything
If you'd pick up that telephone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, how're you feeling?
Are you still the same?
Don't you realize the things we did, and we did, were all for real?
Not a dream
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

Do-wop, doobie do-do-wop
Do-wah, do-lang
Blue days, black nights
Do-wah, do-lang

I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things you planned ain't coming true)

Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight

Okay, so no one's answering
Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer?
Oh, oh, I'll just sit tight
In shadows of the night
Let it ring forevermore, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do-wop, doobie do-do-wop
Do-wah, do-lang
Blue days, black nights
Do-wah, do-lang

I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things you planned ain't coming true)

Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line
Give me some time
I'm living in twilight
