Leaving home, out on the road
I've been down before
Riding along on this big old jet plane
I've been thinking about my home
But my love light seems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's trying to make me stay
You know I got to be moving on

Oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
I might get rich, you know, I might get busted
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
As I get on the 707
Riding high, I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell before you get to heaven

Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Touching down in New England town
Feel the heat coming down
I've got to keep on keeping on
You know the big wheel keeps a-spinning around
And I'm going with some hesitation
You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
Funky shit going down in the city

Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Whoa-oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Whoa-oh, big ol' jet airliner
Carry me to my home
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's there that I belong
