When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else

Thinking how it's going to be
Whenever I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, dont you know
From your head to your toe
Gonna love you all over, over and over
Me into you, you into me, me into you

I am so into you
I am so into you, ooh

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't get to nothing else
I am so into you baby
I can't get to nothing else
No no no come on baby
I am so into you
Love the things you do

Listen baby
Driving me crazy, oooh
Come on baby, oo-ooh
I am so into you
Love the things you do
Come on baby
I am so into you
I am so into you
I am so into you
