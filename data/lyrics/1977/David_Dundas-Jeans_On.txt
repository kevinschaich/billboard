When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)

It's the weekend and I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket, got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

I'll meet ya in the usual place
I don't need a thing except your pretty face
And I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me 

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket, a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch)

When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch)

When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
