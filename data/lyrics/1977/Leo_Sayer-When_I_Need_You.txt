When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be travelin' forever
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away

It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be travelin' a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
Oh, I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keepin' me warm night and day

When I need you
I just close my eyes 
And you're right here by my side
Keepin' me warm night and day

I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And I'm with you darlin'
Yes, I'm with you darlin'

And all I want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away
Oh, I need you darlin'
Oh, I want you
