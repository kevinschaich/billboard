Backstroke lover, always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said "You ain't seen nothin'
Til' you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways."

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, a-like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flying up in the air
A-sing "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
At the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Then I knowed love was here to stay

When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
A-just gimme a kiss!

A-like this
Ooh
Uh

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss a-like this

Seesaw swing with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

She told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss!
