Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone

Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned
