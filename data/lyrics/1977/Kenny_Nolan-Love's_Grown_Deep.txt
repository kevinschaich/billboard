I love you, so much
Somewhere back in time
You became a friend of mine
And day by day we've grown a little closer
You're my spirit to be strong
A friend when things go wrong
So I've written down these words to let you know

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me

As we travel down the road
Side-by-side we'll share the load
Hand-in-hand we'll see each other through
Though we've only just begun
Let's count our blessings one-by-one
I thank God for life, I thank God for you

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me

And as the seasons slip away
Forever lovers we will stay
Together, do-or-die, with all our hearts

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
