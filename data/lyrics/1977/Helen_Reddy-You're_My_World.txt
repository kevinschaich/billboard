You're my world, you're every breath I take,
You're my world, you're every move I make,
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies,
but for me they shine within your eyes.
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine,
I feel a power so divine

You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me.

With your hand resting in mine,
I feel a power so divine

You're my world you are my night and day,
You're my world you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be,
That is the end of my world,
End of my world,
End of my world for me.
