Last night I waved goodbye, now it seems years
I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you, bringing us near
And tell me
When will our eyes meet? 
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

Time in New England took me away
To long rocky beaches and you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me
When will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

I feel the change coming, I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring, I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I had
With you there's a heaven so earth ain't so bad
And tell me
When will our eyes meet? 
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?
Again
