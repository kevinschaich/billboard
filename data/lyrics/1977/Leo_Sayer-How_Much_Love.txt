How much love do you need 
Before you give your love to me 
How much time before it grows 
How much love I wanna know 

What can I do what can I say 
The last thing I want is to drive you away 
How much love does it take 
How much love for heaven sake 

How much love how much love 
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate 
How much love how much love how much love 

Am I tryin' too hard 
Give me some kind of clue 
There must be a way to get through to you 
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate 
Do I rush right in or do I wait 

How much love how much love 
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate 
How much love how much love how much love 

I got so much love 
Don't know where to begin 
I'm pleadin' with you babe 
You gotta let me in
