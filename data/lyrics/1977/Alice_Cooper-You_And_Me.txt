When I get home from work,
I wanna wrap myself around you.
I wanna take you and squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise.

I wanna take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.

But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some lovin',
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
Well that's enough for me.

Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling,
I wanna reach out and touch you,
But you just go on dreamin'.

If I could take you to heaven,
That would make my day complete.

But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some lovin',
And TV, yeah.
That's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, sweetheart
That's just enough for me.

You and me ain't no super stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some popcorn,
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
You're just enough for me.

When I get home from work,
I wanna wrap myself around you.
I like to hold you squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise.

I wanna take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.

You and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Of lovin',
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am well that's what I am.
I tell you, baby,
That's just enough for me.
