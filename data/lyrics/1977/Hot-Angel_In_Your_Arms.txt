ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS

Do you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know

While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you
Now who's really the fool

When I first found out  I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me 
Why'd you keep holdin' on  when love was already gone

The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else
You were only kiddin' yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her 
So don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
