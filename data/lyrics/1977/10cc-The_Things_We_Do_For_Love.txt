Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes

You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Oooh, you made me love you
Oooh, you've got a way
Oooh, you had me crawling up the wall

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes

You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Oooh, you made me love you
Oooh, you've got a way
Oooh, you had me crawling up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love, yeah)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
The things we do for love (The things we do for love, yeah)
