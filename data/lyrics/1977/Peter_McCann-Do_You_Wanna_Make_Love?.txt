Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon,
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon.
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true,
Answer the question I must ask of you .....

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously,
Or take it somewhere else.

Take all the freedom that a lover will allow,
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now.
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep,
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep.

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously,
Or take it somewhere else.

If you wanna get close to me,
You could do it so easily.
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes,
Or just another empty lie?

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Well, do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously,
Or take it somewhere else.
