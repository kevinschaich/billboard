Baby, come as you are with just your heart
And I'll take you in
You're rejected and hurt, to me you're worth
What you have within

I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied, 'cause I'm satisfied
With the love that you can inspire

You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show

Somebody nobody knows could steal the tune
That you want to hear
So stop your running around, 'cause now you've found
What was cloudy is clear, oh honey

There'll be no cheering from the crowd
Just two hearts beating out loud
There'll be no parade, no tv or stage
Only me till your dying day

You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show

(You don't have to be a star)
(You don't have to be a star)
(You don't have to be a star)

Don't think your star has to shine for me to find out
Where you're coming from
What is a beauty queen if it don't mean
That I'm number one?

I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied, 'cause I'm satisfied
With the love that you can inspire

You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show
