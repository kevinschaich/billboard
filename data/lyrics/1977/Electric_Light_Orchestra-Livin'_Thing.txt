Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and sliding
It's magic

And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh, higher and higher baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

I'm takin' a dive (dive, dive...)
Dive (dive, dive...)

Making believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day (I'm takin' a dive)
Moving in line when you look back in time
To the first day (I'm takin', I'm takin')

And you and your sweet desire
(Don't you do it, don't you do it)
Taking me, oh, higher and higher baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

I'm takin' a dive (dive, dive...)
All the same (same, same...)
Hey (hey, hey...)

Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm takin' a dive)
So let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm takin', I'm takin')

And you and your sweet desire
(Don't you do it, don't you do it)
Taking me, oh, higher and higher baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a givin' thing
What a terrible thing to lose
