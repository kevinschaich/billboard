Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins, dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask or is it cool, is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few
