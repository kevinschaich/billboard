Enjoy yourself with me

You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

You sittin over there
Starin into his face
While people are dancin'
Dancin all over the place

You shouldnt worry about things you can't control
Come on girl while the night is young
Why dont ya mix up the place, let it go

Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time you and me
Sittin there with your mouth all out
Just sweet as you can be

Why dontcha live, live the life ya got
Come on girl let's spin it
While the music's live and hot..whoo!

Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

Jackie: Baby girl I've been watchin you?
I want what im waitin for
For you and I to get together

We can tear the house down
Or we can tear the house down
Or we can tear the whole house down..whoo!

Enjoy yourself
