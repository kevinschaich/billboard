For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

Darling, mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling
This love will shine, girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the Heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything
To be your everything

'Cause I'd do anything
To be your everything
