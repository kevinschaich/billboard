(Ah, aha, ah, aha)

You've got a cute way of talking
You've got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead

I'm in the spin, you know 
Shaking on a string, you know 

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, (ooh) dancing, ah

Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired, no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't wanna go home

You put a spell on me
Right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, ah

(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

You take me higher
I want to catch a fire, 'cause

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away, yeah 
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, ah

You really slip me emotion
I can't get off of the floor
All this perpetual motion
You gotta give me some more
You gotta give me some more

And if you'll let me stay 
We'll dance our lives away

You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
I feel, You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
I feel, You make me feel just like dancing
