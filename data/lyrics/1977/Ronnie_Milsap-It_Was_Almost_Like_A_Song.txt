Once in every life ... someone comes along,
And you came to me ... it was almost like a song.

You were in my heart ... right where you belong,
And we were so in love ... it was almost like a song.

January through December ... we had such a perfect year,
Then the flames became a dying ember  ...
All at once you weren't here.

Now my broken heart ... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song ... but it's much too sad to write.

Now my broken heart ... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song ... but it's much to sad to write ...
Much too sad to write.
