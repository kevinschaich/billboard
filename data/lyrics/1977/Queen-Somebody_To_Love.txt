Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody oooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard) everyday of my life
I work 'till I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home (goes home) my hard earned pay all on my own (goes home on his own)
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody oooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Every day - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Oh Lord
Somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm OK, I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!
