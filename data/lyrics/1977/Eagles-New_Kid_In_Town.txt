There's talk on the street
It sounds so familiar 
Great expectations
Everybody's watching you 

People you meet
They all seem to know you 
Even your old friends
Treat you like you're something new 

Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down

You look in her eyes
The music begins to play 
Hopeless romantics
Here we go again 

But after awhile
You're lookin' the other way 
It's those restless hearts 
That never mend 

Oh, Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you
When you're not around?

There's so many things
You should have told her
But night after night 
You're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder 

There's talk on the street
It's there to remind you
That it doesn't really matter 
Which side you're on 

You're walking away
And they're talking behind you 
They will never forget you
Till somebody new comes along 

Where you been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
And he's holding her
And you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town

Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town

There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
