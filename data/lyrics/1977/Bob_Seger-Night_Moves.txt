I was a little too tall 
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants, points, hardly reknown
She was a black hair beauty with big dark eyes
Points all her own sitting way up high
Way up firm and high 
  
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy 
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy 
Workin' on mysteries without any clues 
Workin' on our night moves  
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news 
Workin' on our night moves 
In the summertime 
In the sweet summertime 
  
We weren't in love, oh no, far from it 
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit 
We were just young and restless and bored 
Livin' by the sword 
and we'd steal away every chance we could 
To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods 
I used her, she used me 
But neither one cared 
We were gettin' our share 
Workin' on our night moves 
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues 
Workin' on our night moves  
And it was summertime 
Sweet, summertime, summertime
  
And oh the wonder 
Felt the lightning, yeah
And waited on the thunder 
Waited on the thunder 
  
I woke last night to the sound of thunder 
How far off I sat and wondered 
Started hummin' a song from 1962 
Ain't it funny how the night moves 
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose 
Strange how the night moves 
With autumn closin' in 

mmmm
night moves

I remember (night moves)
Ah sure remember the night moves (night moves)
aint it funny how you remember (night moves)
Funny how you remember (night moves)
I remember I remember I remember I remember (night moves)
oooohh ohh wohh
and we were workin' 
workin and practicin (night moves)
workin and practicin (night moves) all of the night moves 
night moves (night moves)
