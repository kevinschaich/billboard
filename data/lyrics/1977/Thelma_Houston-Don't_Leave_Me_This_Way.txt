Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby

Don't leave me this way, now
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss, don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now, come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
Then come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free

Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby

Don't leave me this way, now
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, baby
Don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?

So come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free
Need your loving, baby, need, need

Satisfy the need in me, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me

Oh baby, Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way, no
Don't leave me this way, no

Don't leave me this way, baby
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way, baby
Oh baby, oh, don't leave me this way, no
Don't leave me this way
