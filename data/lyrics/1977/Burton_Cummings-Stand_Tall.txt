Never been this blue
Never knew the meaning of a heartache
But then again, I've never lost at love before

Somewhere down the road
Maybe all these years will find some meaning
I just can't think about it now, or live 'em out anymore

Chorus
Stand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride
Stand Tall, don't you fall. don't go do something you'll regret later
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride

Never lasted so long
Or through so much - or through so many
I just can't believe I could throw it all away

Sometimes late at night
when there's nothing here except my old piano
I'd almost give my hands to make you see my way

Chorus
Stand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride;
You got me down on my knees for ya, mama
Stand Tall, don't you fall. donn't go do something you'll regret later
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride
