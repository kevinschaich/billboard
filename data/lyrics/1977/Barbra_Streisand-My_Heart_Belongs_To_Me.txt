I got the feelin' the feelin's gone 
My heart has gone to sleep 
One of these mornin's I'll be gone 
My heart belongs to me. 

Can we believe in fairytales? 
Can love survive when all else fails? 
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone 
My heart belongs to me. 

But now my love, hey didn't I love you 
But we knew what had to be 
Somehow my love, I'll always love you 
But my heart belongs to me. 

Put out the light and close your eyes 
Come lie beside me 
Don't ask why. 
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone 
My heart belongs to me. 

(girls) 
But now my love, hey didn't I love you 
Didn't I love you 
Didn't I love you 
Didn't I love you, baby. 

Don't cry my love 
I'll always love you 
But my heart belongs to me. 

I got the feelin' the feelin's gone 
My heart belongs to me. 

(Didn't I love you, didn't I love you).
