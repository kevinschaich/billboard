She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free

She moved in like a friend, started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up 
I was here and she was gone 
Now I'm hanging on 
Maybe you can tell me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong

Where did she go when I need her close to me 
And the perfect story ended at the start 
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 

I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment 
Maybe half the things we sought were never there 
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size 
It isn't really fair 

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
