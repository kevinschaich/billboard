Well, it's been building up inside of me
 For, oh, I don't know how long
 I don't know why
 But I keep thinkin'
 Somethings bound to go wrong

 But she looks in my eyes
 And makes me realize
 When she says
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 (Baby)

 Each morning I awake and fine
 The sunlight softly shining in her hair
 And then I realize that I'm only
 Thinkin' that she really doesn't care
 There's magic in her eyes
 That makes me come alive
 When she says

 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby

 She told me Baby, when you leave today
 Just take along my love with you
 And if you knew how much I loved you
 Baby nothing could go wrong with you
 Oh what she does to me
 When she makes love to me
 And she says

 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 Everything will turn out alright
