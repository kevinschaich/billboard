I've been up to my neck, working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles, of the shoes on my feet
Been dreamin' of getting away, since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now, for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems

Want a towel or a chair, in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades, and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for awhile, and lay back low
No boss no clock no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems

Babe lets get packed, tank tops and flip-flops, if you got 'em
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems
