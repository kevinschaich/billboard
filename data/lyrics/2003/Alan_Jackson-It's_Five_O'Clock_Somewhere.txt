The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
And so am I
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
Gettin' paid by the hour and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him something
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
Half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me
You can tell them I just sailed away

And pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tab
Pour myself in a cab
And be back to work by two
At a moment like this
I can't help but wonder:
What would Jimmy Buffett do?

(Jimmy Buffett enters)
"Funny you should ask, Alan

I'd say, pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane, before I go insane 
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care" (he don't care)

If I don't care
It's Five O'Clock somewhere

"What time zone am I on?
What Country am I in?"

It don't matter it's Five O'Clock somewhere

"It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it"

I heard that

"You've been there haven't you?"

Yes sir

"I've seen your boat there"

I've been to Margaritaville a few times

"Alright, well that's good"

Stumbled my way back

"OK we just want to make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons"

Between the buoys, I got it

"Alright, well it's five o'clock let's go somewhere"

I'm ready, crank it up

"Lets get out of here"

I'm gone
