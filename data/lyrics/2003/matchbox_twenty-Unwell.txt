All day
Staring at the ceiling makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall

All night
Hearing voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold on
Feeling like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Yeah, how I used to be
How I used to be, yeah
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
(Just a little unwell)
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell
(Just a little unwell)
