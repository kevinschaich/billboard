Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt, not feeling pain, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love
Trust
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love
Trust
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love)
And she tore my feelings like I had none
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love)
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
