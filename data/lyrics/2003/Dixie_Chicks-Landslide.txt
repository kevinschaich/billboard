I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh ah (uh ah)
Uh ah (uh ah), uh ah

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I build my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I build my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well, I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe... the landslide will bring you down
