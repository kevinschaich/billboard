Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm okay, here I'll stay with my loneliness
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does, I'll lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does, I'll know
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love
