There she was just a-walkin' down the street
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

She looked good (looked good)
She looked fine (looked fine)
She looked good, she looked fine
And I nearly lost my mind

Before I knew it, she was walkin' next to me
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

We walked on (walked on)
To my door (my door)
We walked on to my door
Then we kissed a little more

Whoa
I knew we was falling in love
Yes I did
And so I told her of all the things I'd been dreaming of

Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Well, I'm hers (I'm hers)
She's mine (she's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime

Whoa
I knew we was falling in love
Yes I did
And so I told her of all the things I'd been dreaming of

Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Well, I'm hers (I'm hers)
She's mine (she's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime

Whoa ohh, oh yeah
Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do (We're singin')
Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do (Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah)
Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do
