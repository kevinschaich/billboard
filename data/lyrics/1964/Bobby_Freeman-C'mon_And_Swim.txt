C'mon everybody, c'mon in
Bobby's gonna show you how to do the swim
Kinda like the monkey, kinda like the twist
Pretend you're in the water and you go like this
Now baby swim, baby do the swim
Just like the dog but not so low
Like the hully gully but not so slow
Now baby swim, baby do the swim
Do what you wanna, do like you wish
C'mon baby now and swim like a fish
Baby swim, now baby come on in
Shake it up baby twist and shout
Now do the swim baby now work it on out
Now baby swim, baby do the swim
Do what you wanna, it's alright
Bobby's gonna show you how to swim tonight
Now baby swim

MUSICAL INTERLUDE

C'mon baby, I want you to swim
Oh yeah, do the dog paddle baby
Now do the backstroke

MUSICAL INTERLUDE

Shake it up baby, twist and shout
Now do the swim baby now work it on out
Now baby swim, baby do the swim
Do what you wanna it's alright
Cause Bobby's gonna do the swim for you tonight
Now baby swim
