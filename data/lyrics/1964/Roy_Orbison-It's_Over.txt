Your baby doesn't love you anymore
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you any more

Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you anymore
It's over

It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
But oh what will you do? Then she said to you
There's someone new, we're through, we're through
It's over, it's over, it's over

All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep, then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows any more
Setting suns before they fall, echo to you that's all, that's all
But you'll see lonely sunset after all

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over
