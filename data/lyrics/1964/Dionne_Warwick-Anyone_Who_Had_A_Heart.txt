Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do?

Every time you go away
I always say
"This time it's goodbye, dear"
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you I'd die, dear

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do?

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me like you hurt me
And be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart would love me, too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in his arms and always love me
Why won't you?
Anyone who had a heart would love me, too, yeah
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in his arms and always love me
Why won't you, yeah
Anyone who had a heart would love me, too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in his arms and always love me
