I love you, there's nothing to hide
It's better than burning inside
I love you, no use to pretend
There! I've said it again

I've said it, what more can I say?
Believe me, there's no other way
I love you, I will to the end
There! I've said it again

I try to drum up
A phrase that will sum up
All that I feel for you
But what good are phrases?
The thought that amazes
Is that you love me and it's heavenly

Forgive me for wanting you so
But one thing I want you to know
I've loved you since heaven knows when
There! I've said it again 

Forgive me for wanting you so
But one thing I want you to know
I've loved you since heaven knows when
There! I've said it again
