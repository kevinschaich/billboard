It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I'll feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow!

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know, I feel all right
You know, I feel all right
