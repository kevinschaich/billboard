In a little café just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man José
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say

Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone
And the night is so long

So we started to dance, in my arms she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
Vamoose, José's on his way
And I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say

Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone
And the night is so long

Then the music stopped, when I looked the café was empty
Then I heard José say, "Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear 
Her say to José

Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone
And the night is so long
