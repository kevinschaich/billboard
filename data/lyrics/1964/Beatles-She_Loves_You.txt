She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

She said she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind

She said she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
Ooh

She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad

You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad
Ooh

She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
