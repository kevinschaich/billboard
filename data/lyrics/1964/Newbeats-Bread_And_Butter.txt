I like bread and butter,
I like toast and jam,
That's what my baby feeds me,
I'm her loving man.

He likes bread and butter,
He likes toast and jam,
That's what his baby feeds him,
He's her loving man.

She don't cook mashed potatoes,
She don't cook T-bone steaks,
Don't feed me peanut butter,
She knows that I can't take.

He likes bread and butter,
He likes toast and jam,
That's what his baby feeds him,
He's her loving man.

Got home early one morning,
Much to my surprise,
She was eating chicken and dumplings
With some other guy.

No more bread and butter,
No more toast and jam,
I found my baby eating
With some other man.
