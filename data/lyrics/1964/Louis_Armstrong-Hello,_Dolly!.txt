Hello Dolly!
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello, Dolly!
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when

So golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Fellas, she'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again
