One, two, three, four!

Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
