If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad, if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin'
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'coz you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Coz they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'coz you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Coz they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me..., to me..., to me...
