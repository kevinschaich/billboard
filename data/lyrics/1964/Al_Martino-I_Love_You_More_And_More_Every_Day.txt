I love you more and more every day

They said our love was just emotion 
That time would slowly fade away
But time's just deepened my devotion
I love you more and more every day

The day you made those tender vows beside me
My joy was more than words could ever say
And, darling, still it grows and grows inside me
I love you more and more every day

The day you made those tender vows beside me
My joy was more than words could ever say
And, darling, still it grows and grows inside me
I love you more and more every day

I love you more and more every day
