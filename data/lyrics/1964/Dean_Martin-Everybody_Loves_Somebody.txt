Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no tellin' where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps sayin'
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

(If I had it in my power)
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
(Then every minute every hour)
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
(Everybody loves somebody sometime)
