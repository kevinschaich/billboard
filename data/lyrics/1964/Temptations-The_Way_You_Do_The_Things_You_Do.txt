You've got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle

The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smelled so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do
Oh baby
The way you do the things the do

As pretty as you are
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute
You know that you could be an hour

The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a cool crook
And, baby, you're so smart
You know you could have been a schoolbook

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do
Oh baby, yeah
The way you do the things you do

You made my life so rich
You know you could have been some money
And, baby, you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do

The way you do the things you do
You really swept me off my feet
The way you do the things you do
You made my life complete
The way you do the things you do
You made my life so bright
The way you do the things you do

You make me feel all right
The way you do the things you do
You make me feel all right
The way you do the things you do
