Well where oh where can my baby be 
The Lord took her away from me 
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good 
So I can see my baby when I leave this world 

We were out on a date in my daddy's car 
We hadn't driven very far 
There in the road straight  ahead 
A car was stalled the engine was dead 
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right 
I'll never forget the sound that night 
The crying tires the busting glass 
The painful scream that I heard last 

Well where oh where can my baby be 
The Lord took her away from me 
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good 
So I can see my baby when I leave this world 

Well when I woke up the rain was pouring down 
There were people standing all around 
Something warm running running my eyes 
But I found my baby somehow that night 
I raised her head and when she smiled and said 
Hold me darling for a little while 
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss 
I found the love that I knew i would miss
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight 
I lost my love my life that night 

Well where oh where can my baby be 
The Lord took her away from me 
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good 
So I can see my baby when I leave this world 

Woh, Woh, Woh, Woh 
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
