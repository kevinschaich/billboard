Round round, get around
I get around
Yeah
(Get around round round, I get around)
I get around
(Get around round round, I get around)
My kinda town
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm a real cool head
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm makin' real good bread

I'm gettin' bugged driving up and down the same old strip
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip

My buddies and me are gettin' real well known
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone

I get around
(Get around round round, I get around)
My kinda town
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm a real cool head
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm makin' real good bread
(Get around round round, I get around)
I get around, round
Get around round round
Wa-wa-ooh, wa-wa-ooh, wa-wa-ooh

We always take my car 'cause it's never been beat
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet

None of the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right
To leave their best girl home on a Saturday night

I get around
(Get around round round, I get around)
My kinda town
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm a real cool head
(Get around round round, I get around)
I'm makin' real good bread
(Get around round round, I get around)
I get around, round
Ooh, ooh

Round round, get around
I get around
Yeah
(Get around round round, I get around)

(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)

(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)
(Get around round round, I get around)
