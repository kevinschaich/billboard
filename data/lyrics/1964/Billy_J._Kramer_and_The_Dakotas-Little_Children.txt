Little children, you better not tell on me
I'm tellin' you little children, you better not tell what you see
And if you're good, I'll give you candy and a quarter
If you're quiet like you oughta be and keep a secret with me

I wish they would go away, little children
Now why ain't you playin' outside? I'm askin' you
You can't fool me 'cause I'm gonna know if you hide
And try to peek, I'm gonna treat you to a movie
Stop your gigglin', children do be nice like little sugars and spice

You saw me kissin' your sister
You saw me holdin' her hand
But if you snitch to your mother
Your father won't understand

I wish they would take a nap, little children
Now why don't you go bye-bye? Go anywhere at all
Little children, I know you would go if you tried
Go up the stairs, me and your sister, we're goin' steady
How can I kiss her when I'm ready to with little children like you around?
I wonder what can I do around little children like you
