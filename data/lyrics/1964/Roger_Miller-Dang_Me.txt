Well, here I sat high, getting ideas
I ain't nothing but a fool to live like this
Out all night, and running wild
Woman sitting home with a month old child
So:

Chorus:
So Dang me, Dang me
They ought to take a rope and hang me
High, from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me
BeupBeupBeupBeupBeupBeupBuem
One More
BeupBeupBeupBeupBeupBeupBuem

Just sitting round drinking with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
Spent the groceries and half the rent
Like 14 dollers and 27 cents

Chorus

They say roses are red, and violets are purple
Sugars sweet and so is maple suprple
But I'm the seventh out of the seven sons
My pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun

Chorus
