A fool never learns
To get away, just run away before his heart begins to break
A fool never learns
He'll wait around, just hang around to see how much his heart can take
A fool never learns
To some girls love is just a game
And some girls treat all fool the same
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

I'm gonna stick by you
I'm a'gonna hang around, wait around
In hopes you'll love me again some day
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time
That there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again
'cause I just can't remove the pain
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

I'm gonna stick by you
I'm a'gonna hang around, wait around
In hopes you'll love me again some day
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time
That there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again
'cause I just can't remove the pain
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing
