My love has no beginning, my love has no end 
No front or back and my love won't bend 
I'm in the middle, lost in a spin loving you 
And you don't know, you don't know 
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am 

My love has no bottom, my love has no top 
My love won't rise and my love won't drop 
I'm in the middle and I can't stop loving you 
And you don't know, you don't know 
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am 

I wish I were a poet so I could express 
What I'd, what I'd like to say yeah 
I wish I were an artist so I could paint a picture 
Of how I feel, of how I feel today 

My love has no walls on either side 
That makes my love wider than wide 
I'm in the middle and I can't hide loving you 

(2x) 
And you don't know, you don't know 
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am 

How glad I am (5x)
