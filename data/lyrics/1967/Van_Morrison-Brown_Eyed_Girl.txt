Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game

Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping and you

My brown eyed girl
A-you, my brown eyed girl

And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall with you

My brown eyed girl
A-you, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when a-we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da
La tee da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown

Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
A-behind the stadium with you

My brown eyed girl
A-you, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when a-we used to sing?
(Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da)
Laying in the green grass
(Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da)
Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit
Sha la la la la la la la la tee da
(Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da)
La tee da, la tee da
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
