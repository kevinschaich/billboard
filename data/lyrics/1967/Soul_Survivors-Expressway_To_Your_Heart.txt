I've been tryin' to get to you for a long time
'Cause constantly you been on my mind
I was thinkin' about a shortcut I could take
But it seems like I made a mistake

But I was wrong
Ooh, took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
Then fellas started to shower
You with love and affection
Now you won't look in my direction

On the expressway to your heart
That expressway, not the best way
At five o'clock
It's much too crowded (too crowded)
It was much too crowded (too crowded)
So crowded (too crowded)
It was much too crowded, oh yeah (oh, too crowded)
So, so, so crowded (oh, too crowded)

Now there's too many ahead of me
They're all tryin' to get in front of me
I thought that I could find a clear road ahead
But I found stop lights instead

But I was wrong
Baby, took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
Then fellas started to shower
You with love and affection
Come on, look in my direction

On the expressway to your heart
That expressway, not the best way

At five o'clock
It's much too crowded (too crowded)
Much too crowded (too crowded)
So crowded (too crowded)
No room for me (oh, too crowded)
(Oh, too crowded)
