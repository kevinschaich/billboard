You wander around
On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore

Ooh, you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for

I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart
Then you take it apart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
Um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
That it's all compromise
And the problems are so over-rated

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh, oh, oh
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(repeat chorus and fade out)
