In the midnight moonlight
I'll be walking a long and lonely mile,
And every time I do,
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And-a it becomes as no surprise to me
with another guy,

Well, here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love,
With a love that's oh so fine
Never to be mine, no matter how I try,

You'll never walk alone,
and you're forever talking on the phone
I try to call you names,
but every time it comes out the shame

Here comes my baby .......
