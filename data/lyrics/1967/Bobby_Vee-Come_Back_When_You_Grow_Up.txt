Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough
So come back, baby, when you grow up

You're lookin' real good, like a woman now
Your mind hasn't gotten the message somehow
So if you can't take it and the goin' gets rough
Come back, baby, when you grow up

I want you, girl, but your wide-eyed innocence
Has really messed up my mind, yeah
I'd rather you get your very first heartbreak
Somewhere else along the line

Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Someday be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up

Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough
So come back, baby, when you grow up

Come back when you grow up, girl
You've still got a lotta time left in the world
You'll someday be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up

Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough
