Written by: Neil Diamond

Daytime turns me off, and I don't mean maybe
Nine-to-five ain't taking me where I'm bound
When it's done, I run out to see my baby
We get groovin' when the sun goes down

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

I'll talk about plans now, baby, I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out the way it should
Talk about money, girl, I ain't got any
Seems like just one time I'm feelin' good

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you
