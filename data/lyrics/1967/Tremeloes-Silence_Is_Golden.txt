Oh, don't it hurt deep inside 
To see someone do something to her 
Oh, don't it pain to see someone cry 
Oh, especially when someone is her

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see 
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see

Talking is cheap, people follow like sheep 
Even though there is nowhere to go 
How could she tell? He deceived her so well
Pity she'll be the last one to know

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see 
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see

How many times did she fall for his lies?
Should I tell her or should I keep cool?
And if I tried I know she'll say I lied
Mind your business, don't hurt her, you fool

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see
But my eyes still see, but my eyes still see
