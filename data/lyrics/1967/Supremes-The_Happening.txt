Hey, life, look at me
I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of
Then you better beware of the happening

One day you're up, then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me, and it can happen to you

I was sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened

I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening

Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh, it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

Once
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

Is it real, is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting

I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah, came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

So sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't
Take care of, then you better beware of
