The beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

Charleston was once the rage, uh huh. 
History has turned the page, uh huh. 
The miniskirt's the current thing, uh huh. 
Tennybopper is our newborn king, uh huh. 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

The grocery store's the supermart, uh huh. 
Little girls still break their hearts, uh huh. 
And men still keep on marching off to war. 
Electrically they keep a baseball score. 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce 
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss. 
The cars keep going faster all the time. 
Bums still cry 'Hey buddy, have you got a dime?' 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da
