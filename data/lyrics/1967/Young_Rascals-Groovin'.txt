Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

Movin' down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can be anyone we like to be
All those happy people we could meet

Just groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no

(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no
Groovin', uh huh
Groovin'
