Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again

I have found a new love, dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me, my darling, let me go

(Please release me, let me go)
For I don't love you anymore
(To waste my life would be a sin)
So release me and let me love again

Please release me, can't you see
You'd be a fool to cling to me
To live our lives would bring us pain
So release me and let me love again
(Let me love, let me love)
