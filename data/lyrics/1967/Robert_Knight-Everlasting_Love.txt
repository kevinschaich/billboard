Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go 
I went away, just when you, you needed me so 
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Won't you forget, welcome love we once knew 

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my, everlasting love 
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride 
You'll never be denied, everlasting love 
From the very start, open up your heart 
Be a lasting part of everlasting love 

(Need a love to last forever) 
(Need a love to last forever) 

Where life's river flows, no one really knows 
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love 
Like the sun shines, endlessly it shines 
You always will be mine, it's eternal love 
When other's love-light's gone, ours will still be strong 
We'll have our very own, everlasting love 

(Real love to last forever) 
(Real love to last forever) 

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my, everlasting love 
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride 
You'll never be denied, everlasting love 
From the very start, open up your heart 
Be a lasting part of everlasting love 
When other's love-light's gone, ours will still be strong 
We'll have our very own, everlasting love
