Close your eyes (close your eyes), take a deep breathe (ahhh!)
Open your heart (open your heart), and whisper
I love you, I love you,
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me,
You love me, You love me.

Hold me tight, (hold me tight), don't say good-night (don't say
Good-night)
We've got the time
Everything's gonna be alright
Just hold me darling, never let me go, and tell me
You love me, you love me, you love me.

Oh no no, (oh no no) even though (even though)
This is not the way I want it to be
But if you must pretend
That's alright with me

Close your eyes (close your eyes), take a deep breathe (ahhh!)
Open your heart (open your heart), and whisper
I love you, I love you,
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me,
You love me, You love me.
