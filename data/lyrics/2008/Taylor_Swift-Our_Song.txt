I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
