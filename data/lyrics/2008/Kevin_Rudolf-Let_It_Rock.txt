I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar 
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you 
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you 
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Lil Wayne
Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop 
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda
And Tamara
Ménagez-moi
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town 
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Baby like socks that's on the ground 
Weezy

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you 
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you 
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Lil Wayne
I'm back like I forgot somethin'
I'm somethin'
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, Like the remainder

Kevin Rudolf
I wish I could be 
As cool as you
And I wish I could say 
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No not this time
