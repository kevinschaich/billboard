(Chorus)
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shawty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killas get hung
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya (I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya(I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there

Baby girl I know it's rough but come with me
We can take a trip to the hood
It's no problem girl it's my city
I could take you there
Little kid wit guns only 15
Roam in the streets up to no good
When gun shots just watch us, run quickly
I could show you where

As long as you're with me
Baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto
Girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Baby it's up to you,
It's whatever you like

(Chorus)
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shawty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killas get hung
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya (I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya(I could take ya...)
Shorty I could take you there

Shawty come with me it's no worry
I know the bad men dem where they ah stay
Police fly pursuit in a hurry
This is no gun play
Don't be scared in a deh West Indies
It's Jamaica, dat's where I'm from
Might see something that you're not used to
Welcome to da slums

As long as you're with me
Baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto
Girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Baby it's up to you,
It's whatever you like

(Chorus)
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shawty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killas get hung
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya (I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya(I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there

Or we (oh we)
Can go (can go)
To a place (to a place)
I know you gonna like (oh oh oh)
The beach (the beach)
The breeze (the breeze)
West Indies, I call it paradise

(Chorus)
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shawty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killas get hung
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya (I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya(I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
