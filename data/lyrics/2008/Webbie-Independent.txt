M-M-Mouse dropped a track

I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean mane
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean
She got her own house, she got her own car
Two jobs work hard, you a bad broad
If you ain't on, sit down (x4)

Webbie
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean
Baby Phat just relax front ya own flat screen
Back rubs cook clean and don't make her make a scene
When you call her on her cellular
She tell you she don't need
Not a god damn thing, you a hot damn thing
If you think you finna get her wit a god damn chain
You insane boy, you betta get some god damn change
She a fool been in school even walked across the stage
She say I love Webbie from his looks to his ways
The Stilletos, the Jays, depend on how the weather look
Flip flops slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own, I dont think she'll never look
In a man face standin' waitin' for him to take care of her
She'd rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

(Chorus)

Lil Phat
She a dumb dime keeper, gutta like Keisha
Work that meat up, she a good freaker
She stay on her shit, she got her own shit
She don't never trip, all she want is that dick
She bossy flossy, keep them hoes off me
Gutta lil slang mane I love when she talkin
A independent chick, do u know what that mean?
She cook, she clean, never smell like onion rings
22s on her whip oh she do it large
And she break a nigga off got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick, a fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades lookin like something
Stallion hair long she a nice sumthing
She like to go to the mall everyday for a outfit
Hair did nails did independent wat she call that

(Chorus)

Lil Boosie
She got her own house, drive her own whip
Range Rover all white like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile
Smell real good
The only time she need mane for that good jugg
They buy the bar too
They superstars too
They be like you ain't got no money
Take you broke tell home
Baby Phat they on
They clothes match they phone
They be like yea!! When they song come on
Leave the club kinda early cuz they gotta go to work
I mess wit supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me
Gucci hat, Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick yes sir
Tryna get next to her gotta be yourself mane
Cuz she got her own money
She don't need no help mane (Boosie)

(Chorus)
