So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Imma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

'Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
Who knows me better
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
