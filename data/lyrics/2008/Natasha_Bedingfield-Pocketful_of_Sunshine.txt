I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, woah
Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, woah

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, woah
Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, woah

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, woah
Wish that you could, but you ain't gonna own me
Do anything you can to control me, oh, oh no

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
My hiding place (my hiding place)

There's a place that I go that nobody knows
Where the rivers flow, and I call it home
And there's no more lies, and the darkness is light
And nobody cries, there's only butterflies

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
My hiding place (a hiding place)

A hiding place (a hiding place)

The sun is on my side
It takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky
I know I'll be all right

The sun is on my side
And takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky
I know I'll be all right
