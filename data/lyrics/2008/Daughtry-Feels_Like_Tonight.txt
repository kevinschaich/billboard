You, you got me thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me come and take a look inside
You, believe me and every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

'Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight
