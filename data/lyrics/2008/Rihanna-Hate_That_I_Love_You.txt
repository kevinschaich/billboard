That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)


But you wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did


But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong


But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you


And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oooh whoa...)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oooh...)


You completely know the power that you have
the only one that makes me laugh


Said and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right


And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so


One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...


Yeaahhh... oohh...


That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)
That's how much I need you

And I hate that I love you soooo...
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no...)
And I hate that I love you so


And I hate that I love you so... soo.
