I got my sight set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will
Never be tame
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowin'
When somethin' is right
I feel like I must have known you
In another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes (I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said
"Oh, she's just bein' Miley"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa, whoa, I
I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feelin'
Deep inside
When you called and asked to see me
Tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader
But I'm readin' the signs (That you can't wait)
That you can't wait
To see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said
"Oh, she's just bein' Miley"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa, whoa, I
I can't wait to see you again

I got my sight set on you
And I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said
"Oh, she's just bein' Miley"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa, whoa, I
I can't wait to see you again
(To see you again)
(To see you again)

Whoa, whoa, I
I can't wait
To see you again
