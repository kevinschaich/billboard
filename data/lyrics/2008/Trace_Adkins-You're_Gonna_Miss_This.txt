She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying "I can't wait to turn 18"
She said, "I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school"
And she kissed her head and said, "I was just like you"

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it, she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says "baby, just slow down"

'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says "they don't bother me 
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23"
Huh, it's hard to believe

But you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this, yeah, you're gonna miss this
