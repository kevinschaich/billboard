Head under water
And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that

You made room for me
But it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leavin'
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today (Yeah)
Today, yeah

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm tryin' to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leavin'
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me (Ah, ah, ah)
That you'll leave the light on (Ah, ah, ah)
To help me see (Ah, ah, ah)
With daylight, my guide, gone (Ah, ah, ah)

'Cause I believe, there's a way (Ah, ah, ah)
You can love me because I say I won't write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one (Mhm)
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this

Is that why you wanted, a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this
If you're on your way (Oh, oh)
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute (for a minute)
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today (write you a love song today)
Today, yeah
