Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean

Now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

'Cause it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back

'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

But it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a will in me
And now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go
I won't go

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

But it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

But it's not my time 
I'm not going
There's a will in me
And now it's gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know, oh

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

But I won't go
Oh no, I won't go down
Yeah
