Konvict, konvict

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And noticed that that pinky ring is right enough baby

I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up baby

And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, I seem to know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, I see it so you don't have to say a word

Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right
Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Girl you know that you need to stop

Girl I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl, and I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, I seem to know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, I see it so you don't have to say a word

Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right
Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got (oooh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (oooh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (oooh)
Girl you know that you need to stop

Can't tear our eyes away from you girl
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body
The kind that remind 'em of something like you
And you're that kind of girl, that type to drive a man crazy
And snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back he'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thang you do
Ya had him crawlin' on hands and knees
And ya find a way to get him off of that cheese
And why ya thinkin' that you the only dude?
She's off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' eberybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool

Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right
Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Always talkin' bout what you got (eh)
Girl you know that you need to stop
