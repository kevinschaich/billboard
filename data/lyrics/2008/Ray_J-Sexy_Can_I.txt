Sexy can I 
Yeah, yeahhh 
All we wanna know is...

(Chorus:) 
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners?
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera 
All I wanna know is, sexy can I. 
Sexy can I, hit it from the front, 
Then I hit it from the back. 
Know you like it like that. 
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor 
Then we chill for a second, then we're back at it for more 
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners. 
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera 
All I wanna know is, sexy can I. 

(Yung Berg:) 
What up lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin 
G5 dippin, Louis Vuitton luggage (ay) 
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly 
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a nigga go by. 
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh 
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi. 
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince 
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since. 

(Ray J:) 
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners. 
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera 
All I wanna know is, sexy can I. 
Sexy can I, keep it on the low. 
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo. 
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo. 
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo. 
(Oh, ohh, ohh) Now look shawty, look shawty. 
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh, ohh, ohh) 
(I don't know what your man is like but shawty all I want to know is:) 
Sexy can I. 

Sexy can I, visit you at work 
When you sliding down the pole, 
No panties, no shirt. 
Then you climb back up the pole, 
Then you drop and do the splits. 
How you make that pussy talk, 
Baby damn, you is the shit 
(Oh, ohh, ohh) Now look shawty, look shawty. 
I make it rain in the club like (Oh, ohh, ohh) 
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is:) 
Sexy can I 

Sexy can I, just pardon my manners? 
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera 
All I wanna know is, sexy can I. 

(Yung Berg:)
I ain't concerned with who ya boy's hittin, or who Ray's melon 
When I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin' 
See I'm a go getta and she a go getta 
You already know, yeah 
(Sexy can I) 
Sexy can I send for you red-eye 
Fresh out the pool no towel 
Let it air dry
And if you ain't fuckin' tonight 
Then you can watch that tour bus go by 

(Chorus:) 
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners? 
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh baby) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera 
All I wanna know is, sexy can I. 
Sexy can I, hit it from the front, 
Then I hit it from the back. 
Know you like it like that. 
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor 
Then we chill for a second, then we're back at it for more 
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners. 
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh) 
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
