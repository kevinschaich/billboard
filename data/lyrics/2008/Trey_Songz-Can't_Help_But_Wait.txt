I can't help but wait 
Ohh uh 
Can't help but wait 

I see you, you with him
He ain't right but you don't trip 
You stand by while he lies 
then turn right round and forgive 

I can't take to see your face 
With those tears runnin down your cheeks 
But what can I do 
I gotta stay true 
Cause deep down I'm still a G

And I don't want to come between you and your man 
Even though I know I treat you better than he can 

Girl I can't help but wait 
Till you get back with him it don't change 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see that with me it ain't the same 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see you for what you really are 
Baby girl you are a star 
And I can't help but wait 

It aint fresh to just let him call the shots 
You're a queen you should be 
Gettin all that someone's got 
You should be rockin the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than that occasional
"I love you, I'm thinking of you" 

And I don't wanna come between you and your man no 
Even though I know I treat you better than he can 

Girl I can't help but wait 


Till you get back with him it don't change 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see that with me it ain't the same 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see you for what you really are 
Baby girl you are a star 
And I can't help but wait 

Get it together 
You can do better 
See is believin 
And I see what you need so 
I'm going to play my position 
Let you catch what you've been missing 
I'm calling out 

Girl cuz I can't help but wait 
Till you get back with him it don't change 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see that with me it ain't the same 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see you for what you really are 
Baby girl you are a star 
And I can't help but wait 

Till you get back with him 
It don't change 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see that with me it ain't the same 
Can't help but wait 
Till you see you for what you really are 
Baby girl you are a star 
And I can't help but wait 

Can't help but wait 
I can't help but wait 
Ohohoh 
Can't help wait 
No oh no oh no oh
