I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared

It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and 
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear,
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and 
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things 
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine, when we're intertwined
Everything's all right
I wanna be with the one I know

And the seventh thing I like the most that you do (Ohh)
You make me love you
Sha Sha 
You do, oh
