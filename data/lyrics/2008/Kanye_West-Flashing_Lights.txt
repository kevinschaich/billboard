Connie Mitchell:
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Kanye West:
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, "I love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

Dwele and Connie Mitchell:
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

Kanye West:
I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

Dwele and Connie Mitchell:
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)

Connie Mitchell:
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
