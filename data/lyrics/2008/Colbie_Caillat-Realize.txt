Take time to realize
That your warmth is 
Crashing down on in

Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if
We missed out on each other now

Take time to realize
Oh oh, I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?

Take time to realize
This all can pass you by 
Didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you,
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if
We missed out on each other but

It's not the same
No it's never the same
If you don't feel it too
If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way
It could be the same for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realize what I just realized
If you just realize what I just realized

Ooh ooh ooh

Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now

Realize, realize, realize, realize
