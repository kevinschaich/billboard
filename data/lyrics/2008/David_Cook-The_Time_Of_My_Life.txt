I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life...my life

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life
The time of my life
The time of my life
