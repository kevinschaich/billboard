Bust It Baby
Aye can I please talk to my bust it baby real quick homie
Let me bring you in my world, and let you know what i call my lil bust it baby

If i wasn't married to the streets, it'd be you
Yo lips what make you so cute
Love when you poke yo mouth out when you mad too
Save your number in my phone under Lil Boo
Like your sex but more love what cha do
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, i don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan around you, all i can say is "Ooh"
My favorite panties of yours the ones that see-through
One wit the pink trim on 'em and they light blue
Speakin' for the goons, thank god for makin' you
BUST IT BABY is what i call you

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor mayne, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang, ask around they know us

He just gon' hurt you, and neglect you
Well they gon' say what they wanna, yeah
I made a promise, to do you right and i'm gonna
Girl i'll do everything i can, prove i'ma better man

She got me speedin' in the fast lane

I juss gave her a nick name, it's wet-wet
Cause when we finished she mess up all the bedsets
She got somethin' to relax me when i'm under stress
Never told her, or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you had told me it was this good, i'da never guessed
She full of surprises, i don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep i sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BABY i keep 'er on deck

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor mayne, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang, ask around they know us
they know that's my..
BUSTTTTTT ITTT... bay babyyyy
Everybody know that's my..
BUSTTTT ITTT... bay babyyyy
Everybody know thats mine
