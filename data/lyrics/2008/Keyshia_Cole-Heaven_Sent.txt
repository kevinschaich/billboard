Sent from heaven.
Sent from heaven.

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
It don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

(CHORUS:)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What they feelings from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Love ain't what you thought that could've been.
Oh that's when you change
And you don't feel as good as you used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Everything you used to do went right out the door

Ooooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before


What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you lust 
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

(CHORUS)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say 
I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say 
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say 
I wanna be the one who
I wanna be the one who's (sent from above)

(CHORUS:)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
