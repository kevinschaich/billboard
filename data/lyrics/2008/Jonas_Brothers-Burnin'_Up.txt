I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Said we're burnin' up in this place tonight
The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (yea, come on, Nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
