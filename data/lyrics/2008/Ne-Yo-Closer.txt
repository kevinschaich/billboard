Closer, closer, closer, closer (Woo!)

Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are

Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

Come closer! (Come closer!)
Come closer!

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)

And I just can't bring myself away
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop

I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I got the more I want
She wants to own me

Come closer!
She says come closer, hey

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)

And I just can't bring myself away
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop

Come closer, come closer, come closer, come closer
come closer, come closer, come closer (oh)

I just can't stop no, no
I just can't stop no, no
I just can't stop no, no

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)

And I just can't bring myself away
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)

Come closer!
