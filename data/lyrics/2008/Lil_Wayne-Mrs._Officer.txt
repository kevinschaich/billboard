When I get up all in ya,
We can hear the angels callin' us,
We can see the sunrise before us,
And when I'm in that thang,
I make that body sang, (Deezle on the beat)

Doing a buck in the latest drop,
I got stopped by a lady cop,
She got me thinkin' I can date a cop,
'Cause her uniform pants are so tight,
She read me my rights,
She put me in the car,
She cut off all the lights,
She say I have the right to remain silent,
Now i got her hollerin',
Soundin' like a siren talkin' 'bout,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee,
And I know she the law
And she know I'm the boss,
And she know I can hide above the law,
And she know I'm raw,
She know I'm from the street,
And all she want me to do is fuck the police,

Talkin' bout,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee,
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee, (Yeah)

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer,
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya,

That ass so big, I catch a battery to hold ya,
Hands so big you thought I told you pull it ova',
She pull me ova',
Pulled me out the Rover,
Then she pulled me closer,
Threw me in the back of the car,
Put me in handcuffs,
Start rippin' my pants off,
(All you hear over the dispatcher is..)

And I can't wait to get it on,
I wanna do it all night long,
