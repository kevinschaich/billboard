I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you,
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
It's too late to apologize, yeah,
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
