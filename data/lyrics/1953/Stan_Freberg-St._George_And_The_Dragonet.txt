The legend you are about to hear is true
Only the needle should be changed to protect the record


This is the countryside
My name is St George
I'm a knight

Saturday, July 10th, 8:05 pm
I was working out of the castle on the nightwatch
when a call came in from the Chief
A dragon had been devouring maidens
Homicide
My job, slay him


You call me, Chief


Yes, the dragon again, devouring maidens
The King's daughter may be next


Mmm-hmm
You got a lead


Oh, nothing much to go on
Say, did you take that .45 automatic
into the lab to have them check on it


Yeah, you were right


I was right


Yeah, It was a gun

8:22 pm, I talked to one of the maidens
who had almost been devoured


Could I talk to you, Ma'am


Who are you


I'm St. George, Ma'am
Homicide, Ma'am
Want to ask you a few questions, Ma'am
I understand you were almost devoured by the Ma'am
Is that right, dragon


It was terrible
He breathed fire on me
He burned me already


How can I be sure of that, Ma'am


Believe me
I got it straight from the dragon's mouth


11:45 pm
I rode over the King's Highway
I saw a man
Stopped to talk to him
Pardon me, Sir
Could I talk to you for just a minute, Sir


Sure, I don't mind


What do you do for a living


I'm a knave


Didn't I pick you up on a 903 last year for stealing tarts


Yeah, so what
Do you wanna make a federal case out of it


No, Sir
We heard there was a dragon operating in this neighborhood
We just want to know if you've seen him


Sure, I've seen him


Mmm-hmm
Could you describe him for me


What's to describe
You see one dragon, you seen 'em all


Would you try to remember, Sir
Just for the record
We just want to get the facts, Sir


Well, he was, you know, he had orange polka dots...


Yes, Sir


Purple feet, breathing fire and smoke...


Mmm-hmm


And one big bloodshot eye
right in the middle of his forehead and
Uh, like that


Notice anything unusual about him


No, he's just your run-of-the-mill dragon, you know


Mmm-hmm
Yes, Sir
You can go now


Hey, by the way, how you gonna catch him


I thought you'd never ask
A Dragonet

3:05 pm
I was riding back into the courtyard
to make my report to the lab
Then it happened
It was the dragon


Hey, I'm the fire-breathin' Dragon
You must be St George, right


Yes, Sir


I can see you got one of them new .45 caliber swords


That's about the size of it


Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You slay me


That's what I wanted to talk to you about


What do you mean


I'm taking you in on a 502
You figure it out


What's the charge


Devouring maidens out of season


Out of season
You'll never pin that rap on me
Do you hear me, cop


Yeah, I hear you
I got you on a 412 too


A 412?
What's a 412?


Over-acting. Let's go


On September the 5th, the Dragon was tried and convicted
His fire was put out and his maiden-devouring license revoked
Maiden devouring out of season is punishable
by a term of not less than 50 or more than 300 years
