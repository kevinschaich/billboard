First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, you are love
Really mine in the rain

In the dark, in the sun
Oh, like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms
