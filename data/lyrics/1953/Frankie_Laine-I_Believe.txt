I believe for every drop of rain that falls 
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray 
Some one will come to show the way
I believe,  I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer 
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere 
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry 
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
I believe, I believe

I believe the lord in heaven  he is my guide 
My sins he'll hide 
I believe on calvary that jesus died 
That pierced side 
I believe in death we'll part to rise again
And meet in heaven to that loud amen
Then I know why, I believe.
