No other love have I
Only my love for you! 
Only the dream we knew
No other love! 

Watching the night go by
Wishing that you could be 
Watching the night with me
Into the night I cry! 

Hurry home
Come home to me! 
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing! 

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I
No other love! 

(Into the night I cry!) 

Hurry home
Come home to me! 
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing! 

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I! 
No other love! 
(No other love!) 
No other love!
