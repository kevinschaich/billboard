With these hands, I will cling to you
I'm yours forever and a day
With these hands, I will bring to you
A tender love as warm as May

With this heart, I will sing to you
Long after stars have lost their glow
And with these hands, I'll provide for you
Should there be a stormy sea
I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never
No, I'll never let you go

With these hands, I'll provide for you
Should there be a stormy sea
I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never
And I'll never let you go
