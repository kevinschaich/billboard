Kick the dust up.
Come on.

All week long it’s a farming town they're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road
They take one last lap around,
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where there ain’t nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now,
Better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up,
Back it on up,
Fill your cup up,
Let’s tear it up up
And kick the dust up.

Bar downtown, they got a line of people waiting out the door.
10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside, I don’t know what they're waiting for.
Got me a jar full of ‘Clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it’s like knock knock knock goes the diesel,
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where there ain’t nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now,
Better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up,
Let's back it on up,
Fill your cup up,
Let’s tear it up up
And kick the dust up.

Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge you all gonna be glad you did.
Kick it.

We go way out where there ain’t nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party.
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now.
Better have your boots on,

Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up,
That's what's up up,
Let's kick the dust up
