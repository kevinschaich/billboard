Baby girl, you're so damn fine though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine though
And when it's over, I press rewind though

Ay, you talking bands, girl, I got it

All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ay, yeah baby

Remy Boyz
Tell me what you see
Is it money or it’s me?
I smoke twenty, smell the weed
I got hunnies in my V
They like "Monty, can you be my baby daddy?", I’m like "Yeah."

I got robins on my jeans, you see the wings on every pair
All you see is Remy Boyz, you know my niggas everywhere
And if somebody got a problem, we could meet up anywhere
Now go say something, don’t you niggas play dumb
You know where we came from, you don’t want sauce, no A1

We can light and stain up here

Got my city looking rude

But I think I need a girlfriend
