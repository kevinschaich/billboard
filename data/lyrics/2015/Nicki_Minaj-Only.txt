Nicki Minaj
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape

Worried 'bout if my butt's fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons
John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ring finger where the rock is
Deez hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

Bad bitches who I fuck with
Mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Chris Brown
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Drake
I never fucked Nicki, 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know, LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties do'

Yeah, low key it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me? I mean
It doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly, I mean
She say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch wit you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston, Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable

Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck wit you
The NBA players fuck wit you, the bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck wit you
Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki, if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up so I can plan for it

(Pinkprint, aye)

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Lil Wayne
I never fucked Nick and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she actin' like, she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove; the holy Mecca

Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga

For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"
