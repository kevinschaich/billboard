'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last

Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts

Mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
