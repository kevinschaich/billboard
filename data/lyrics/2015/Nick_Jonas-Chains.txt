With her wine-stained lips, yeah she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch but she’s warm as a devil
I gave all my heart but she won't heal my soul
She tasted a break and I can’t get more

You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love

Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

Alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door
Oh no, wasted again but I can’t say no (no)
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul

You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love

Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul

You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love

Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
