I'm hurting, babe, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You've got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees

I don't want to be needing your love
I just want to be deep in your love
And still in me when you're away
Ooh baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are
I just want to be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

My broken pieces, you picked them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
When I'm without you, oh, so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

I don't want to be needing your love
I just want to be deep in your love
And still in me when you're away
Ooh baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are
I just want to be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day
I don't want to play no games, you don't got to be afraid
Don't give me all that shine shit, no makeup on, that's my

Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
