Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 
You got the healing that I want 
Just like they say it in the song 
Until the dawn 
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

We got this king size to ourselves 
Don't have to share with no one else 
Don't keep your secrets to yourself 
It's Kama Sutra show and tell, yeah

Woah, there's lovin' in your eyes 
That pulls me closer 
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble 
But I'd love to be in trouble with you 

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 
You got the healing that I want 
Just like they say it in the song 
Until the dawn 
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

You got to give it up to me 
I'm screaming, mercy, mercy, please 
Just like they say it in the song 
Until the dawn 
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

And when you leave me all alone 
I'm like a stray without a home 
I'm like a dog without a bone 
I just want you for my own 
I got to have you, babe 

Woah, there's lovin' in your eyes 
That pulls me closer 
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble 
But I'd rather be in trouble with you 

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 
Ooh, babe, I got that healing that you want, yes
Like they say it in the songs
Until the dawn 
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 
You got the healing that I want 
Just like they say it in the song 
Until the dawn 
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 

You got to give it up to me 
I'm screaming mercy, mercy, please 
Just like they say it in the song 
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on 
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, ooh
