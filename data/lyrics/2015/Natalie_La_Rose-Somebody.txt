Comm'on
Natalie La Rose

I wanna rock with somebody (whoah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, comm'on, comm'on)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody (nobody)

Walking everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate what's new
We just do our thing no time to waste
Always playing cool

And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do

I wanna rock with somebody (whoah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, comm'on, comm'on)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody (nobody)

Walking everybody know what's good
We are only block
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is going up (tonight is going up)

And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do

I wanna rock with somebody (whoah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, comm'on, comm'on)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody (nobody)

And the club like whoah
We'll be in the party in the club like whoah
And the club like
We'll be in the city going down like whoah
And the club like whoah
We'll be in the party in the club like whoah
We'll be in the city going down like whoah
We'll be in the party in the club like whoah

And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do

I wanna rock with somebody (whoah yeah)

I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, comm'on, comm'on)
