Nah nah honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got somebody at home

It’s been a long night here, and a long night there
And these long long legs are damn near everywhere
(hold up now)
You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I gotta be like oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby’s already got all of my love

So nah nah honey, I’m good 
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got to bid you adieu
To another I will stay true
(oo oo I will stay true)
(oo oo I will stay true)

Now better men, than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
(Now check it out)
I’ve got her, and she got me
And you’ve got that ass, but I kindly gotta be like
Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby’s already got all of my love

So nah nah honey, I’m good 
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got to bid you adieu
To another I will stay true
(oo oo I will stay true)
(oo oo I will stay true)

Oh, I’m sure ya, sure ya will make somebody’s night
But oh, I assure ya assure ya, it sure as hell's not mine

Oh no, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got somebody at home
And if I stay I might now leave alone
No honey I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got to bid you adieu 
To another I will stay true

No, no, honey, I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got somebody at home
And if I stay I might now leave alone
No honey I’m good
I could have another but I probably should not
I’ve got to bid you adieu 
To another I will stay true
True ooo, ooo

(I will stay true)
(I will stay true)
(I will stay true)
(I will stay true)
Sing it now oh whoa oh
