You know from the moment she turned around
She knows how to back it up and drop it down
She knows, she wants all the fellas looking at her
'Cause they know as soon as our song come, it's a wrap

Does she love the attention?
Does she get it when she moves?

Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

She knows
She knows
I know, I know, she knows
And I know, I know, she knows

She bad mixing ratchet with the classic girl
So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me
I told her, shawty
You so right, but you so wrong
She said, daddy, I'll be back after this song
Then you're taking me home

She loves the attention that she get when she move
Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

She knows
She knows
I know, I know, she knows
And I know, I know, she knows

She loves the attention that she get when she move
Showin' out with her homegirls
Hypnotizing all the dudes

She knows
She knows
I know, I know, she knows
And I know, I know, she knows
