Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...
Ooh

I will never find another lover sweeter than you
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you

Girl, you are close to me, you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother

You are the only one, my everything
And for you, this song I sing

All my life, I prayed for someone like you
I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

Baby

Said I promised to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you

All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me

You're all that I've ever known
Your smile on your face
All I see is a glow

You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I've ever known
When you smile, your face glows

You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I've ever known
When you smile, your face glows
You picked me up when I was down

And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me too

And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do, love me too

And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
