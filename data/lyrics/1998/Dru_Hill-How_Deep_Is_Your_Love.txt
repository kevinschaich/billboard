Yeah, whoa...

(SISQO)
1ST VERSE:
Hey mami you know that I like it when you call me papi
But it seems like lately baby that you've been seeing another chico
And baby you know that he can't go down like me
And you know that the nigga can't freak like me
So mami tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me

(Chorus)
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now

Ven aqui little mami
Puerto Rican I see the way you wiggle it
The way you move your body
He can't make it get wetter than me
But I bet he keep telling you he better than me
Ooh you know that he can't go down like me
And you know that he can't go freak like me
So baby tell me one little thing
How deep is you love for me

Repeat Chorus(x2)

(Girl)
Ay Nokio
Te extrano mucho
Ven aqui mi papi morenito
Y damelo duro
Damelo papi chulo

Repeat Chorus until fade
Repeat Chorus until fade
