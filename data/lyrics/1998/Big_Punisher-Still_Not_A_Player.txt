whoahhaoohhH! Yeahheahhaa
Don't wanna beeeee a playahh

Intro/Chorus: Joe, Big Punisher

 I don't wanna be a playa no more
 I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
 But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin for
1 -  For my thugs, for my thugs
2 -  Uptown baby, uptown
 Don't wanna be, don't wanna be - I don't wanna be a playa no more
 I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
 But you know Big Punisher still down by law
 Who's down to crush a lot


Hey yo I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, French count seats, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my, I'm big huh, I rip my *prick* through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my *dick* with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get HOOF

Chorus


I love from puerto rican to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of that *ass*
Long as you show class, and pass my test
Fat *ass and* breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown *hoe* wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'ma let you know
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
(You nasty Twin) I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks *come*


(In the) hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I *stick it* even Luke be like "Don't stop, get it get it"
(repeat 2X)

Chorus w/o Big Punisher


Boricua, morena, boricua, morena (3X)
No more rollin with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad

Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher
Punisher... Joe and Big Punisher

Boricua, morena, boricua, morena (6X)
