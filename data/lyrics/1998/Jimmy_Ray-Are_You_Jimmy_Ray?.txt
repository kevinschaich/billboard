Well!!

Who wants to know? Who wants to know?

Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know)
Are you Lame Ray? (Who wants to know)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?

Hey, can you tell when you look in my eye
You don't mess around with me
'Less you feelin' dangerous.

Are you into my scene, lay it on the line
Ya come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous.

Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener.
With a reefer, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer.

Are you Johnny Ray? (Who wants to know)
Are you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know)

Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know)
Are you Lame Ray? (Who wants to know)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?

Maybe we can shake it down by the walk
Do you think I'm takin' liberties?
Are ya dangerous?

I've gotta let it, somethin' in my jeans
Ya come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous.

Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener.
With a reefer, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer.
