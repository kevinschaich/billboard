— Excuse me. Can I please talk to you for a minute?
— Uh huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
— Yeah, you do too... but um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named... you know his name
— Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
— I just want to let you know that he's mine
— Heh... no no. He's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame?

Well, maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All of my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it girl, it's true

I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have that you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture?
You're the past and I'm the future
Anyway, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (to see)
The boy is mine (that the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special places in my heart
He was my lover from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

You need to give it up (you need to give it up)
Had about enough (about enough)
It's not hard to see (it's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (not yours — but mine)
Had about enough (not yours — but mine)
It's not hard to see (not yours — but mine)
The boy is mine

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
