Make ya feel good , make ya feel all right
One time
Feel good yea ya'll
Busta Rhymes in the place ya'll
Make you feel real good ya'll
Flipmode is the squad in the place ya'll

Buck wild for all of my niggas who don't care
floss like a bunch of young black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my gun
Stackin my ones
floss a little, invest up in a mutual funds
Blowin the horn since the very day I was born
never dreamed I see a nigga landscapimg my lawn
Dangerous, my niggas shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so emaculate
A yo a yo watchin my dough, sippin my moe
Slippin in slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Any wiggle hittin this play oil of oley
Little honey dip whip in within a little cabriolet
I don't mean to hold you up
But I got somethin to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us
That's when we gettin dangerous
Come on

Chorus:
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause to much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

Hold your breath
We swingin it from right to left
Word to Wyclef
nigga'z shit be hot to death
Stayin alive, you know only the strongest survive
Holdin my heat
under my seat , whippin the five
Baseline for all of my people movin around
Give me a pound
All of my niggaz holdin it down
cuttin you up
The new shit wrekin you up
fuckin you up
My black hole suckin you up
Back in the days niggaz use to be ass out
Now a nigga holdin several money market accounts
Blaze the street and then I would just like to announce
Feelin my grove
My jiga jiga makin you bounce
Others is fare, me and my niggas breakin the bridge
Straight gettin it, we got you niggas holdin your head
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous
Come on

Chorus

One time ya'll
Throw your hands real high ya'll
Yea, get down ya'll
Let me see you all ya'll
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode ya'll
Nineteen ninety eight ya'll
Ha, get down ya'll, lets have a ball ya'll

Feelin the heat up in the street rockin the beat
Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat
Comin around, all of my niggaz surround me
So much bottles of liquer, ya'll niggaz will drown me
Makin ya drunk, feelin the funk, blazin the skunk
Stay hitten with the shit that blow a hole in ya trunk
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous
Come on

Chorus
