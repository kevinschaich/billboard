(Jermaine Dupri Talking:)
Yo See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all ya'll other...out there doin' what I'm doin'
Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't
Cause I do what I do my way.
What about you?
Huh? huh?
Come On.

(Usher:)
I Do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say oh oh.
Why is he so fly-y-y?
She beeps me, whenever she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up
Cause she likes it...

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Usher
My way, My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes, and I'm in control.

(Jermaine Dupri:)
Bad ass senorita's, two seaters with kicks
And new kick's bitch ya'll all up in my mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catchin' bricks don't concern me
So forget young midget, My minds on 7 digits
Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pullin' all stops
Knockin' down all spots
Sayin' you can't front on me
So from this day forth you know It's all about me
And what I do be the major league
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
and she know like you know, you don't see her like I see her
So she's out the do'.
(Usher & Jermaine Dupri:)
Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, system, bassing conversation.
(Jermaine Dupri:)
All about how she be chasin' me and facin' me sayin' give it to me now.

Jamie Foxx & Jermaine Dupri:
Baby.

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Usher
My Way, My Way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes and I'm in control.

(2nd Verse: Usher)
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far then
She had to have every chance that she could get
But you think you a baller
And I ain't gon' call her
Clip that, you can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up
Cause she likes it...

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Usher
My Way, My Way.
My Way My Way My Way.
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way.
Oh yeah.
What I say goes and I'm in control.

My Way 
Oh My Way
My Way.
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way.
What I say goes and I'm in control.

I do any & everything you want to
You can't satisfy her needs
she keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
I do any & everything you want to ohh
What I say goes and I'm in control.
