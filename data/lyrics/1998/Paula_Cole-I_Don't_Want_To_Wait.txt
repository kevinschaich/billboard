So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the peace in every eye

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye
