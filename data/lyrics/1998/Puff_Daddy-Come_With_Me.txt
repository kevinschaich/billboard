Uh-huh yeah (2x)
Uh uh-huh yeah (4x)
Yeah

Hear my cries, hear my call
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my error, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss

Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap

Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes, come with me

Come with me
Yeah
Come with me
Uh-huh yeah
Yeah

You said to trust you, you'd never hurt me
Now I'm disgusted, since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me, ridiculed me
Left me hangin', now shit's boomerangin'

Right back at ya, think long-ranged
Narrow minded, left me blinded
I co-signed it, shit backfired
But I'm bouncin' back, I grinded

Not many would bear the pressure, you comprehend me
You musn't end me, you offend me
It's trauma, feel the drama
Come with me

Yeah
Uh-huh
Heh-heh
Come with me
Don't be afraid
Yeah
Come with me

I close my eyes
And I see
You, standing there
I cry
Tears, of sorrow
I die

Uh-huh
Yeah

Fuck my enemies, fuck my foes
Damn these hoes, is steppin' on my toes
Back up off me, take your hands off me
Give me room to breathe

I'm not hearin' it, I'm not fearin' it
I'm up to my ears in it, bullshit
I'm destructive, some women find that seductive
Some say it's lunacy, but luckily I've been movin' on

I ignore you, sorry if I call you
I neglect you, don't mean to disrespect you
Can't you see, I love you dearly
And not sincerely, but you annoy me

You can't avoid me, I'm here to stay
Forever, and ever in a day that's never
I can't let you go, I can't forget it
Why you did it, I won't permit it

I won't acquit it, I wanna to fight you
I'll fuckin' bite you, can't stand nobody like you
You can't run, you can't hide
No surprise, close your eyes
Come with me

Yeah
Come with me (2x)

Owwwww.....
Yeah I like this
Come on (2x)

Hear my cries
Hear my call
Lend me your ears

Uh-huh
You ready now
Come on check this out

Hear my cries, hear my call
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my errors, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss

Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap

Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes, come with me

I'm gonna to fight you, I'll fuckin' bite you
Can't stand nobody like you
You can't run, you can't hide
No surprise, close your eyes
