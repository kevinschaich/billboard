(fade) What, what, what,
(fade) Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Uh, (fade) Here we go, here we go, here we go,
(fade) check check, check check,
Uh, what

Baby, when the lights go out
(yeah, uh here we go)
()check check)
I'll show you what it's all about
(Coming at you, girl)
(You're gonna like this, girl)
(Here we go)

I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treating you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kickin' it wit u girl

Baby it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me
( You Must believe)
Baby, it's not part of the deal
Oh no no

(Chorus)
Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will soon come to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

(Ah, yeah, check it)
(Check it out)
(Second verse, girl)

I know you think it may be just a lie
Ain't no good in putting up a fight
'Cuz my heart is set on you
I see the trust is in your eyes
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise
I can see I'm getting through, babe

Girl, don't deny the way you feel
You know you gotta trust me
(You gotta trust)
Give me a chance to prove I'm real
Oh yeah, yeah

(Repeat chorus twice)

It's a blackout girl, the lights are off,
I can feel you getting close and I take your clothes off, 
Your body looks so soft,
In between the sheets I lay you down,
Girl, I wanna knock your socks off,
Knock your block off,
I'm down for whateva,
there are few things thats foreva,
Like you in my life, girl,
Thats all I need to get by, 
Time to break down cuz your making me high.

(Uh)
(Yeah, I like that)
(You know what I mean)

(Repeat chorus)

Baby, when the lights go out
(When the lights go out)
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
(I'll show you what it's all about)
Babe I swear you will soon come to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

(Repeat chorus to fade)
