I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)(8x)



I live my life as a thug but girl you know I need ya
Each and ever women that I meet damn they don't wanna be ya
It ain't no limit to what we could do
Holla if ya hear me girl you know I'm comin' through
I'm out here on the grind livin' my life fast
And if you really love me lay some blankets on the grass
I know the way I live make you wanna cry
But you know I gotta hustle that's the way I survive
It ain't no changin' me but me and you could make it
Let's fix a plate of ghetto love with grits eggs and bacon
Let me wipe away your ghetto tears misery and pain
All you need is a passport I got the hookup and a private plane

(chorus)
Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you



For a while tears are all that we shared our love was fading so fast
Was right now is wrong gaining fast baby
In the night I sat alone wanting you crying out for you
Wondering who's loving you baby
Something happened along the way the love that we shared has gone away
We tried and tried for a better day for that day girl I pray

Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
Holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)(3x)
I love you ohhhhhhh holla if you hear me
Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye bye
