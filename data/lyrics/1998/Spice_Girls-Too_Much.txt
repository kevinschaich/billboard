Melanie B:
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
Emma:
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns, but will this never end?
Melanie C:
Well, my dear, you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me

All:
Too much of something is bad enough
Emma:
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
All:
Too much of nothing is just as tough
Emma:
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Geri:
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Victoria:
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
Melanie C:
Yes, my dear, you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

All:
Too much of something is bad enough (Melanie C: Bad enough)
Emma:
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
All:
Too much of nothing is just as tough (Melanie C: Just as tough)
Emma:
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Melanie C:
What part of no don't you understand? (Understand, understand)
I want a man, not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

All:
Too much of something is bad enough
Emma:
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
All:
Too much of nothing is just as tough
Emma:
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

All:
Too much of something is bad enough (Melanie C: Bad enough)
Emma:
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
All:
Too much of nothing is just as tough (Melanie C: Just as tough)
Emma: 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

All:
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
