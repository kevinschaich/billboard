Oh-ohoh-ohoh 
oh-ohoh-ohohoh 
oh-ohoh-ohoh 

Am I givin enough, is it all it sould be 
When the water gets rough, will you still swim with me? 
So afraid to come close, I know that it may be too soon 
It may be too much, for you to consume 

Chorus: 
And I wanna know if I can live inside your world 
And I wanna know if I can give it to you girl 
You know that I wanna say it, 
You know that I need to say it, 
You know that I'd love to say it, 
My love just goes on and on and on 

I give you all that you need, there's no better place you could be 
And I know that in time, you'll believe me 


So please hold out your hand, and let's exchange these golden bands 
Cause I want you in my life, I want you to be my wife 

(chorus) 

My girl, is so special 
I wanna give it all to you, loving you on and on 
My girl, is so special 
I wanna give it all to you, loving you on and on 

You know that I wanna say it, 
you know that I need to say it, 
you know that I'd love to say it, 
My love just goes on and on and on 
(repeat 1) 

My love just goes on and on and on
