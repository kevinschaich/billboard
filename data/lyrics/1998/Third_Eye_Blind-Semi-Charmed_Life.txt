I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start

I want something else
