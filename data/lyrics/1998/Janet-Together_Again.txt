There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby

When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
Hey it's about you baby
Look deeper inside you baby

I dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again, ooh) Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh) Makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh) Say it loud and proud 
(Together again, ooh) All my love's for you

Always been a true angel to me, now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Wrap them around me baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)'

Sometimes hear you whisperin', no more pain
No worries will you ever see now baby
(Ever see my baby)
I'm so happy for my baby
(Happy for my baby)

I dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again, ooh) Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh) That makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh) Say it loud and proud 
(Together again, ooh) All my love's for you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby

What I'd give just to hold you close as on earth
In heaven we will be together, baby
(Be together, baby)
Together again my baby
(Together again, my baby)

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me
