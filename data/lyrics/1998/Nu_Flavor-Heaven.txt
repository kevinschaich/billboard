Heaven,Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me

First time I saw you girl you turned me upside down
I can't stop thinkin bout ya my head is spinning round
I got to find a way to get with you somehow
Girl I'm so crazy for you you know I want you now
And every minute of every single day
I'm dreamin of how it could be
And every night before I go to sleep
I'm praying that soon you'll be here with me

Heaven,Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I'm down on my knees please help me

Can't fall asleep tonight I don't know what to do 
I hold my pillow but I wanna be holding you
And when I close my eyes I always see your face
I know my happiness is only a kiss away
And every hour here in the dark
And every beat of my lonely heart
Tells me that I need to be with you 
Heaven oh heaven what can I do

Heaven heaven oh heaven can't you help me 
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I'm down on my knees please help me

(spanish)
la primera ves que te mire
no a podido dormir 
tu estas en mi corason y en mi suenos
y cada noche le pido a dios que vulva juntos para siempre

Girl I'd give anything if you were here with me
Give you anything you want and anything you need
I never thought that I could feel the way I do
But now I wanna spend the rest of my life with you
And every day that we are apart 
I'm saving this love here in my heart
And every night before I go to sleep
I'm prayin that soon you'll be here with me

Heaven heaven oh heaven can't you help me 
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I'm down on my knees please
Heaven heaven heaven heaven (fade out)
