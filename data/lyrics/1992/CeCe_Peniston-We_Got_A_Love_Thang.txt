Can't stand it when you're away
Without a doubt you're the best thing that's happened to me

And I just can't wait to have you by my side
You know whenever you're around
A smile is all that you're gonna see, yeah

'Cause you make me feel so good inside
And there is no doubt, yeah, I'm satisfied
I know that I won't find a better love
I've got a love that other girls dream of, heyeyey

No, no

Suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and all my lonely days are gone
They are gone, oh no

I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than a lonely night
I know that I won't find a better love
I've got a love that other girls dream of, heyeyey
