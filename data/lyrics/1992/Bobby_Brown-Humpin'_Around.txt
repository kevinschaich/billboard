When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you

And you claim that you
Don't care where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

Girl you don't trust no one
And you constantly in doubt
You lose the game
If you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

When you love someone
And you want to love 'em right
Got to get more lovin' about cha

When you know
That you're holdin' on too tight
Soon they will be leavin' without you

Say that you love someone
Why you callin' all my friends
Thinkin' I got somethin' to hide

Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game
If you, if you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl when you love someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around

And the more I think about it
You'll lose all your clout and
You lose the game baby
If you play that way

Back to the BB Brown
Back to the BB Brown

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called so
Don't try to step on me wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cuz I just want to kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya, just like I told ya

I wanna roll on the tip that's moving
Able to make you move and groove
And leave you like ooh when I touch ya
Give you so much of the feeling of the deck
That I'm dealing when I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in our style
So what I've come to do is kick you something fly and new
A change, different from the typical a bit more than regular
Not like the others original, 'cuz originality
And creativity add it up together equals the B.B.B. posse
Yeah, we've in the house, yo kick it

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
