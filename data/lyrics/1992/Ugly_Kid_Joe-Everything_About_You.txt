Are you the guys on the beach who hate everything? Eww.
Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?

I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, I hate beach and mountains too, boo hoo
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I hate the countryside too

And I hate everything about you
Everything about you

And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo hoo
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
'Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

And I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you

Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again, 'cause I ain't wearing no frown

Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed, and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad, well, that's too bad
'Cause I'm havin' a ball
Hatin' every little thing about you, ha ha

Everything about you
Everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I

Hate everything about...
You, haha
