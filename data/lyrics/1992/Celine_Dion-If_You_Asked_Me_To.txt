Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone

I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home, that I'm finally home

I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you

Asked me to, I will give my world to you, baby
I need you now (I need you now)
Asked me to, I'll do anything (Anything) for you, baby
For you baby

(If you asked me to)
I'd let you in my life forever
(If you asked me to)
All you gotta do is ask me to
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do is ask me to

(If you asked me to)
I will give my world
Everything, everything, baby!

(If you asked me to)
I couldn't ask what you do to me
If you asked me to

(If you asked me to)
