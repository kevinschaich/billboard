Sorry you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes and see
True love comes for free

I'm keepin' my heart open
Hopin' you won't stab me in it

When I had to pay I didn't

I lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me
How much will it be?

No more than I'm willin' to give (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you won't pay nothin'
For this good lovin' (Alright), it's for free

And I won't make you promises 
I'll just do all I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand

The best things in life are free (Yeah)
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me

And it's easy to give it
When I know you feel (Yeah, yeah) the same way too

That's all I expect from you
Just be all that you can

You know I know it's not about the dough
So baby, baby, if you wanna be my lady
