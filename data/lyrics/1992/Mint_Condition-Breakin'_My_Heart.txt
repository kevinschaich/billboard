Pretty brown eyes, you know I see you;
It's a disguise, the way you treat me... (The way you treat me...) (Pretty brown eyes...)

You keep holding on to your thoughts of rejection;
If you're with me, you're secured...

You keep telling me that your time is always taken,
But I keep seeing you out alone... (Out alone...) Yeah... (Pretty brown eyes...)

Listen to love - your heart is pounding with desire
Waiting to be unleashed...

Quit breakin' my heart...

Don't tell your friends that I don't mean nothin' to you;
Please don't deny the truth... (Pretty brown eyes...)

Tell me right now, I know your heart is in the right place;
You know I won't let you down, yeah...

You can't disguise all the pounding of your heart, yeah;
(I see your eyes...) I see your eyes (Pretty brown eyes...), and you can't hide...

Start to make sense, and quit playin' these love games;
