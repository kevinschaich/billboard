Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun making me sweat
Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet

The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

But I can walk
No, I can't dance
No, no, no I can't dance
No, I said I can't sing
But I
