This old life seemed much too long
With little point in going on
I couldn't think of what to say
Words just vanished in a haze
I was feeling cold and tired
Yeah, kinda sad and uninspired

When it almost seemed too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic in your touch

Oh, lay your hands
Lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (woo hoo)
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands

Back and forth across the sea
I have chased so many dreams
But I have never felt a grace
That I have felt in your embrace
I was tired and I was cold
Yeah, with a hunger in my soul

When it almost seemed too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic of your touch

Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Lay your hands, woo hoo
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands, oooh

You know make me feel so good
Yeah, like I never ever thought I would
You know you make me feel so strong
And now our laughter just goes on and on (and on)
So c'mon lay your hands on me
'Cause close to you 
Is where I really wanna be

And if it ever gets too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic in our touch

Oh, lay your hands
Lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (Woo hoo)
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands
Ooh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (Woo hoo)
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands
