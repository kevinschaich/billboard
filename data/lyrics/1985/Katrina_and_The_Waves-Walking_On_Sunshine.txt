Ow

Mm, yeah
I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life just a-waiting for you
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay

Oh, yeah, now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Yeah, oh, yeah, now
And don't it feel good

Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine

I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine, baby, oh
Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby 

Oh, I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah now
And don't it feel good
Now don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it
And don't it feel good
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
And don't it feel good
Now don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it
And don't it feel good
Now tell me, tell me, tell me again now
And don't it feel good
Oh, yeah, now

Oh, don't it feel good, don't it feel good
Now don't it feel good
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
