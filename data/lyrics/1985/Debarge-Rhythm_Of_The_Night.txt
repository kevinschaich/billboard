When it feels like the world is on your shoulders,
And all of the madness has got you going crazy.
It's time to get out, step out into the street,
Where all of the action is right there at your feet,
well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away,
You'll be doing fine when the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night,
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning,
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget
So, come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home,
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known.
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long.

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night,
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah


Come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home,
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known.
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long.

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, (oh baby, I'm crying)
Forget about the worries on your mind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, (oh baby)
Forget about the worries on your mind.

La, la la la.
La, la la la.

The music's playing,
It's a celebration
The music's playing,
Everybody dance to the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind, 'cause you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night...
