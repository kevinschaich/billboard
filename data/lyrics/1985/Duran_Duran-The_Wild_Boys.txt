The wild boys are calling 
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to 
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered 
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside 
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us, 
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome 
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while 
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels 
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over 
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you 
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
