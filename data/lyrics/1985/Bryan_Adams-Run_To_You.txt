She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I
Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause

When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right, I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let you down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round
I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you

I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Oh, when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

(When the feeling's right now)
(Oh)

Oh, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you

Oh, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
Oh, when the feeling's right now
Oh yeah, when the feeling's right now

I'm gonna run to you
Oh, oh

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, now
Oh, I'm gonna run to you, run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
