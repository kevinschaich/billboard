There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true

Can you feel me tremble when we touch?
Can you feel the hands of fate
Reaching out to both of us?
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl, it's too late to turn back now

Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

And there's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl, it's too late to turn back now

I can see you tremble when we touch
Ooh, and I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back
I can't hold back
I can't hold back
I can't hold back
I can't hold back
