Shout, shout, let it all out 
These are the things I can do without 
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on 

Shout, shout, let it all out 
These are the things I can do without 
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on 

In violent times 
You shouldn't have to sell your soul 
In black and white 
They really, really ought to know

Those one track minds 
That took you for a working boy 
Kiss them goodbye 
You shouldn't have to jump for joy 
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out 
These are the things I can do without 
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on 

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out 
These are the things I can do without 
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on 

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out (let it all out)
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart 
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out (break your heart)
These are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

Shout, shout, let it all out (they really, really ought to know)
These are the things I can do without (they really, really ought to know)
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on (they really, really ought to know)

Shout, shout, let it all out (break your heart)
These are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
