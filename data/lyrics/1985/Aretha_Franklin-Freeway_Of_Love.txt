Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right
Yeah!

Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go...go...go!

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side
Ah-hah ah-hah

With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' along
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about your love slowin' down, yeah

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go...go...come on now...go!

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?
Oh yeah!

Here we go (here we go, here we go, here we go)
One more time
With the wind and
Your fingers in my hair
Kinda think we're going for an extended,
Throwdown...
So drop the top baby
And let's cruise on into
'It's better than ever Street'

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go...go...come on baby...go...do it for me now

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

What I want you to do baby (freeway of love)
Get over in the left lane
And let's march for peace, aw yeah (freeway of love)
Take the long exit...
And then again around town (freeway of love)
Go on over to Love and Satisfaction
And Joy y'all, well (freeway of love)
Oh...ain't we ridin' baby
Ain't we cruisin' down

(Free) Free (Free) Free (Free) Free (Free---way)
Go on out to
Oww... (Free)(Free)(Free) (Free---way)
"Let's be good to each other" Street'
Well (freeway of love)
See that little landmark over there?
A whole lotta kisses and sweet stuff (freeway of love)
We'll be just about...oh..oh...oh...it's Satisfaction Road, yeah
(Free)(Free)(Free) (Free---way)
Satisfaction, Yeah
