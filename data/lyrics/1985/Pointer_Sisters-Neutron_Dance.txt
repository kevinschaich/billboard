I don't want to
Take it anymore
I'll just stay here
Locked behind the door

Just no time to
Stop and get away
'Cause I work so hard
To make it everyday

Whoo, oooh
Whoo, oooh

There's no money
Falling from the sky
'Cause a man took my heart
And robbed me blind

Someone stole 
My brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due
I got no place to stay

Whoo, oooh
Whoo, oooh

And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance

Industry don't pay
A price that's fair
All the common people
Breathing filthy air
(Lord, have mercy)

Roof caved in on
All the simple dreams
And to get ahead your heart
Starts pumping schemes

And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance

Whoo, oooh
Whoo, oooh
I'm on fire, yeah
I'm on fire, yeah

And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance
I'm just burning doin'
The neutron dance

I know there's
A pot of gold for me
All I got to do
Is just believe

I'm so happy
Doin' the neutron dance
And I'm just burning
Doin' the neutron dance
I'm so happy
(It's in my hands)
Doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burning
Doin' the neutron dance
(It's in my feet)
