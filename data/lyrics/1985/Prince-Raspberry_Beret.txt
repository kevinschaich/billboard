Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her 
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm

So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a 
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no

(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No no no
No no no (The kind you find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)

Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love...
