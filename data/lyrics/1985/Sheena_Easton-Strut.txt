He said, "Baby, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you use your imagination?"
(Oh no, oh no)
"Nations go to war over women like you
It's just a form of appreciation"

"Come on over here, lay your clothes on the chair 
Now let the lace fall across your shoulder"
(Oh no, oh no)
"Standing in the half-light, you're almost like her
So take it slow like your daddy told ya"

Strut, pout, put it out 
That's what you want from women
Come on, baby, whatcha takin' me for?
Strut, pout, cut it out
All takin' and no givin'
Watch me baby, while I walk out the door

I said, "Honey, I don't like this game
You make me feel like a girl for hire"
(Oh no, oh no)
"All this fascination with leather and lace 
Is just the smoke from another fire"

He said, "Honey, don't stop a speeding train
Before it reaches it destination"
(Oh no, oh no)
"Lie down here beside me, oh, have some fun too
Don't turn away from your true vocation"

Strut, pout, put it out 
That's what you want from women
Come on, baby, whatcha takin' me for?
Strut, pout, cut it out
All takin' and no givin'
Watch me baby, while I walk out the door

I won't be your baby doll
Be your baby doll
I won't be your baby doll
Be your baby doll

Strut, pout, put it out 
That's what you want from women
Come on, baby, whatcha takin' me for?
Strut, pout, cut it out
All takin' and no givin'
Watch me baby, while I walk out the door

Strut, pout, put it out 
That's what you want from women
Come on, baby, whatcha takin' me for?
Strut, pout, cut it out
All takin' and no givin'
Watch me baby, while I walk out the door
