I want my MTV

Now look at them yo-yo's, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
(Move-a, move-a... uh)

(We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries)
We gotta move these refrigerators
(We gotta move these color TV's)
Look here, look here

I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Oh, man we could have some

And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's

Listen here
Now, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Money for nothin' and your chicks for free (Money for nothin', yeah)
Get your money for nothin' (What's that?)
And your chicks for free (Look at that, look at that)
Get your money for nothin' and your chicks for free (I want my, I want my, I want my MTV)

Money for nothin' and your chicks for free (I want my, I want my, I want my MTV)
