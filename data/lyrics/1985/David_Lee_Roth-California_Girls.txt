Well, east coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The midwest farmers' daughters
Really make you feel alright
And the northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
I dig the girls

I wish they all could be California (wooh)
I wish they all could be California (wow)
I wish they all could be California girls

The west coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island coast
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I've seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States
Back to the cutest girls in the world
I dig the girls

I wish they all could be California (wow)
I wish they all could be California (wooh)
I wish they all could be California girls
Wow

(Girls, girls, girls, yeah I dig the girls)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls, yeah I dig the girls)
I wish they all could be California
Hey, hey, hey (Girls, girls, girls, I dig the girls)
I wish they all could be California
California Girls (Girls, girls, girls, I dig the girls)
I wish they all could be California
