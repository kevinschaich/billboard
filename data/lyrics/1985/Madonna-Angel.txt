Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
Oooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

Clouds just disappear
