I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against
The child in your face
Won't escape my attention

You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out
'Til I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire, I'm watching it burn
Yeah, thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now, just how long will it last?
Now, now, now, have you no ambitions? (Mmm, what's the matter with my)
My mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean air 
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
And dreaming I'm a doctor 
(Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby)
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand 
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
Oh, I feel so

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out
'Til I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four-leaf clover
I'm on the line, one open mind
This is my four-leaf clover

La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la

La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
In my mind's eye
La, la, la, la, la, la
One little boy, one little man
La, la-la-la, la, la la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Funny how time flies
