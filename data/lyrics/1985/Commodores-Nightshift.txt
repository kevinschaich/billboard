Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing his song
His heart in every line
Marvin, sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Oh talk to me, so you can see, what's goin' on
Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds 
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, 
It's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift, oooh
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Jackie, mmmm, hey what you doing now
It seems like yesterday, when we were working out
Jackie, oh, you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us 
Your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up, and we'll be there at your side
Oh, say you will, sing your songs
For evermore, evermore, evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night (gonna be a long night) 
It's gonna be alright, on the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Gonna be some sweet sounds (sweet sounds)
Comin' down, on the nightshift (oh on the nightshift)
I bet you're singing proud (I know you're singing proud)
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd (oh yeah)
Gonna be a long night (gonna be alright) it's gonna be alright
On the nightshift, on the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Gonna miss your sweet voice, (sweet)
That soulful noise (soulful noise)
On the nightshift, nightshift (on the nightshift)
We all remember you, remember you, remember you
Oooh you're songs are comin' through
Oh oooh oh oooh oh oh oh
At the end of a long day (a long day) 
It's gonna be OK (OK)
On the nightshift, nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Gonna be some sweet sounds, sweet sweet sounds
