Growin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all

But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone
Everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done

You know in some way
You're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're tryin' to break free

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire, ooh

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road

I can make it
I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire
Burnin' in me, burnin' in me

Just once in his life
A man has his time
And my time is now
I'm comin' alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like your man again
And hope ridin' high

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire burnin' in me

Burnin'
Burnin' in me
I can feel it burnin'
Ooh, burnin' inside of me
