We belong
We belong to the light

Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
