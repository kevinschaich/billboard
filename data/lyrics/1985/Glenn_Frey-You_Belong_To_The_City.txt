The sun goes down, the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls

You're out of your room and down on the street
Movin' through the crowd in the midnight heat
The traffic roars and the sirens scream
You look at the faces, it's just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye, you were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again and you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it

You can hear it
You're getting near it
You're gonna make it
'Cause you can take it (ooh)

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night

You belong
You belong
Oh
