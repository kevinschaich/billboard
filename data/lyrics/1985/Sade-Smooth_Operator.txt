He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jukebox life, diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights, business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
No sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago
Western male
Across the north and south to Key Largo
Love for sale

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross, yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
