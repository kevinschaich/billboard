Yeah
Come on

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by ya
Make you look like a fool, boy

Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in; he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Alright!

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed

Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Oooh!

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

Yeah, just sittin' back trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Well alright, ooh, yeah
Well alright (Alright), come on now
Well alright (Alright), ooh, yeah
Well alright (Alright), come on now

Oooh
Ooohooo
Ooohooo
Ooohooo

Alright, boys, keep it rocking now!
Keep on goin'
We gonna go home now
We're goin' home
Alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Well alright,
Let's go!
