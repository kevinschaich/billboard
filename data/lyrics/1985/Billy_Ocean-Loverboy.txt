I don't know
What you've got
But it plays with my emotions
I want you so much

Darling I
Want to hold you near
Want to whisper sweet and tender
In your ear
Can't stand the thought of you
With somebody else
Got to have your love
Got to have it all to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Wanna be your lover lover uhmm
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy
Lover lover yeah
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy

Too far gone
It's hard to stop
Baby you're my dream in motion
And I won't give up
Uhmm Teasing me
With your fire
My finger's on the trigger
Your the one I desire
Cause I have this feel good feeling
From nobody else
Got to have your tenderness
All to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Wanna be your lover lover uhmm
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy
Lover lover yeah
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy

And I want you really
But the thing is there's nothing I can say
To stop you darling
From running running away
Won't you stay stay stay

I wanna be your love
I gotta be your love
I wanna be your love

And I can't stand it baby uhm uhm...
