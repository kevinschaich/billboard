Kissing you was not what I had planned 
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand 
I wasn't looking for true love 
But now you're looking at me 
You're the only one I can think of 
You're the only one I see 

CHORUS: 
All I need 
Is just a little more time 
To be sure what I feel 
Is it all in my mind 
Cause it seems so hard to believe 
That you're all I need 

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before 
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore 
It may be a chance we're taking 
But it always comes to this 
If this isn't love we're making 
Then I don't know what it is 

All I need 
Is just a little more time 
To be sure what I feel 
Is it all in my mind 
Cause it seems so hard to believe 

CHORUS 

No stars are out tonight 
But we're shining our own light 
And it's never felt so bright 
Cause girl the way I'm feeling 
It's easy to believe 
That you're all I need 

Ahhhh 
You're all I need 
Oooooh ahhhh
