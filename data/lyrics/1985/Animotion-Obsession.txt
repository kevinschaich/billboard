I cannot (I cannot sleep) sleep

Unopened at your feet
There's no balance (There is no balance)
No equality (No equality)
Be still (Be still)
I will not (I will not) accept defeat (accept defeat)

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

I feed you I drink you
My day and my night
I need you I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest; you want to leave
Stay, oh, (there's no alternative) there's no alternative

Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger beware
Of circumstance in your naked dreams
Your affection is not what it seems

You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

My fantasy (My fantasy) has turned to madness (has turned to madness)
And all my goodness (and all my goodness) has turned to badness (has turned to badness)
My need to possess you has consumed my soul
My life is trembling; I have no control

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you
