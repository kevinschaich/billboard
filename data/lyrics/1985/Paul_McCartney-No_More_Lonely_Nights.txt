I can wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter

But another lonely night
Might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

Yes, I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights, no no
