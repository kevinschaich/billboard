Late at night, body's yearning 
Restless night, want to be with you 
Someone's playing in the garden 
So enticing, should I  take a bite 
I don't know what's come over me, yeah 

She's as heavy as a Chevy 
Pure excitement, misled 
When she touches, can't resist her 
I'm a puppet when she's playing 
She's outgoing but I love her so 
Misled 

So I'm saying now 

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame 
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name 
What's this crazy place you want to take me to 
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you 

My heart, my soul, my love 
Is that  the goal? 
The  thrill then I will 
Hey misled, be for real 

Thought I knew her, this lady 
Opportunist, misled 
Always searching for adventure 
Like Pandora's box, misled 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do without her 

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame 
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name 
What's this crazy place you want to take me to 
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you 
My heart, my soul, my love 
Is that the goal? 
The  thrill then I will 
Hey misled, won't you be for real

I've got this feeling that  it's rocking  my way 
But I love her just the same, just the same 
Oh yes I do 

Misled, heard you call my name 
Misled, what's your claim to fame 
Misled, took me by the hand
Misled, said I would understand 
Misled, boulevard of broken dreams
Misled, not a pretty scene 
Misled, baby, that's your name 
Misled, what's your claim to fame 
My heart, my soul, my love 
Is that goal? 
The thrill then I will 
Misled, won't you be for real

Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame 
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name 
What's this crazy place you want to take me to 
Tell me, what's the price If I go with you 

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame 
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name 
What's this crazy place you want to take me to 
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you 
My heart, my soul, my love 
Is it the goal? 
It's a thrill then I will 
Be misled, be for real

Misled, misled 
Misled, misled 
I was misled by you 
Misled, misled
