The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

Ever had that feeling
Almost broke in two
Said that you were leaving
Like you do, you do

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near

Never had that feeling
Until I first met you
Never felt like kneeling
Now I do, yes I do
Yes, I do, ooh

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Oh, be near me, be near
Be near, be near

The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near

Be near me, be near
What's your reputation? 
Ecstasy
What's your inclination?
Next to me
