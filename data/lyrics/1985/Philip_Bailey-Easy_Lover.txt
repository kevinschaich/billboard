Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it

No, you'll never change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
For she'll say that there's no other
'Til she finds another
Better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it

And don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh

No, don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

She's an easy lover (she's a easy lover)
