Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, woah

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out

Love's strange, surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling down, down, down

Will you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling down, down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, woah

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defences
Vanity, insecurity, oh

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
When you walk away?

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Or will you walk away?
Will you walk on by?
Come on, call my name 
Will you call my name?

I say a la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

When you walk on by and you call my name
