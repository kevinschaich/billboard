Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong
With part-time lover

If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word "discreet"
With part-time lovers

But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek to you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you
My part-time lover

And then a man caught our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers

You and me
Part-time lovers
But she and he
Part-time lovers
