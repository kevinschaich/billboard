Uh-huh-huh, doo-doo
Bah bah bah-ah-ah

Talking away, ah
No, I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
Oh, I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends, but I'm me
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, the things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just to play
My worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
Yeah, you're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone (take on me)
In a day (take me on)
(Take on me)

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
Take on me
Take me on
