Everybody's saying silly things 
Without knowing that life brings a change 
And I've been checking all the signs
My friends say I'm love sick cause I... 
All I keep thinking about is her in my arms 
(Got to see what love is all about) 
And I won't be the same until she is mine 
And my friends keep telling me to 

Cool it now 
You got to cool it now 
Ooooooh watch out 
You're gonna loose control 
Cool it now 
You got to slow it down 
Slow it down... 
You're gonna fall in love 

Everyday I walk her home from school 
And she tells me how she really feels 
And there's no doubt in my mind 
That this girl is one of a kind 
Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is about) 
And I won't feel the same until she is mine 
But my friends keep telling me to

Cool it now 
You got to cool it now 
Ooooooh watch out 
You're gonna lose control 
Cool it now 
You better slow it down 
Slow it down... 
You're gonna fall in love

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down 
Slow it down...
You're gonna fall in love

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms 
(Got to see what love is all about) 
And I'll never be the same until you are mine 
And my friends keep telling me.. 

When ya got a girl who takes her time 
You must slow the pace you can't mess with her mind 
If she feels the same she'll letcha know 
Just prepare yourself or be ready to go 
And I hope this message stays in your mind 
Cause you almost lost a girl who is right on time 
There's one more thing that ya got to know 
Just cool it down and stay in control 

Cool it now 
You got to cool it now 
Ooooooh watch out 
You're gonna lose control 
Cool it now 
You got to slow it down 
Slow it down... 
You're gonna fall in love baby

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms 
(Got to see what love is all about) 
And I'll never be the same until you are mine, oh
Listen to me let me tell you 

Why you all coming down on me 
Tryin to tell me how my life is supposed to be 
I know you're only trying to help me out 
Tryin to show me what life is really about 
But this time I'm gonna make it on my own 
So why dontcha fellaz just leave me alone 
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike 
If I like the girl who cares who you like
