My sugar walls
My sugar walls

Where I came from
There's a place called Heaven
That's the place where
All the good children go

The houses are of silver
The streets are gold
But there's more
Where you come from
My sugar walls

My sugar walls, ooh
My sugar walls

Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion
When passion is hot
Temperatures rise
Inside my sugar walls

Lemme take you somewhere
You've never been
I can show you things
You've never seen

I can make you never
Wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

Take advantage, it's all right

I feel so alive
When I'm with you
Come and feel my presence
It's raining tonight

Heaven on Earth
Inside my sugar walls

Let me take you somewhere
You've never been
I can show you things
You've never seen

I can make you never
Wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

I can tell you want me
(My sugar walls)
It's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it
Come inside (my sugar walls)

Ahhh (my sugar walls) ooh
Come inside (my sugar walls)
My sugar walls

(My sugar walls)
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

(My sugar walls)
(My sugar walls)
