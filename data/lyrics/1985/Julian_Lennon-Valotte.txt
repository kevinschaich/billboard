Sitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford
I can feel you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of her love?
It fits so tight, closer than a glove

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong?
'Cause I felt it all along

I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there?
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are
We've always got our troubles, so we solve them in the bar
As the days go by we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong?
'Cause I felt it all along

Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down
I can see you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
When will we know when the change is gonna come?
I've got a good feeling, and it's coming from the sun

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong?
We'll stick together 'cause we're strong
