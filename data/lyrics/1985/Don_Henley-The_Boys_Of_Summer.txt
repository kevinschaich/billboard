Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home

But I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, "don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby 
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
