Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time

We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion, their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light 
Or end in the dark
Is it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome

All the children say
(We don't need another hero)
We don't need another hero
(We don't need to know the way home)
(All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome)
