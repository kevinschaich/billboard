How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes
