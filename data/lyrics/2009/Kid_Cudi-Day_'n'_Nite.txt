Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast (what, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

Hold the phone (what, what)
The lonely stoner, mister solo do-lo (what, what)
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade (what, what)
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made

The pain is deep (what, what)
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (what, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

When the tempo slows up and creates that new new (what, what)

The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool

The lonely nights (what, what)
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes (what, what)
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way (what, what)
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
