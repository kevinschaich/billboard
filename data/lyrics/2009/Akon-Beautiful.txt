Kardinal told you
Whether the sky blue or yellow
This fella ain't that mellow
If it ain't about you (you)
Hourglass shape make the place go (ooohhh)
Waistline makes my soldier salute
I'mma brute (brute)
High from your high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin' in the fast lane
Eyes like an angel (goddess)
Watch my yellin' as she undress
Spotless (otless) bad to the bone
Make me wanna go put me in the triple X zone (zone)
Lames don't know how to talk to you
So let me walk with you, hold my hand
I'mma spend them grands, but after you undress
Not like a hooker, but more like a princess
Queen, empress, president
Pull any way ya got my love
'Cause your beautiful (okay??)
