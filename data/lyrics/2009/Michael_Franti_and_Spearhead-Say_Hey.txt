This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say, hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you, baby girl
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner, always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, girl, I hoped it was you
And when I looked into your eyes, I knew it was true

I say, hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you, baby girl
I love you, I love you, I love you

Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes, and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you

I say, hey, I be gone today
But I be back around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you, baby girl
I love you, I love you, I love you

And I say, rocking in the dance, hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey, trippa, trippa, got to shoot

Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma

My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing that I love you

I say, hey, I be gone today
But I'll be back around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

I say, hey, I be gone today
But I'll be back around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you, baby girl
I love you, I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey papa, hey papa, hey momma, hey momma
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
Come on, hey papa, hey papa, come to shoot
(Hey mama, hey mama)
