Hey, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you pimpin'

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...

Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped, here that's next
So they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
Could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin' smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now I think about "Damn, what a life I had"
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I had done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)

Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright 'cause...

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh (hey)

Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...
