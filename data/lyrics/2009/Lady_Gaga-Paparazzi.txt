We are the crowd
We're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastico

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi (ya-ha)
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be 
Your papa-paparazzi (ya-ha)

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl 
Backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar
In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi (ya-ha)
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be 
Your papa-paparazzi (ya-ha)

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap-snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi (ya-ha)
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be 
Your papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine (yah-ha)
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
