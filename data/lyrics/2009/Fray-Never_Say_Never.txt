Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without, just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Picture: you're the queen of everything
As far as the eye can see, under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time,time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

We're falling apart and coming together again and again
We're coming apart but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
