I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur

Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow

And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
All across this new divide

In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret
And each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide
All across this new divide
All across this new divide
