Now I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Yea I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Nigga I know you don't call yourself hollerin' at my girl
I know you don't call yourself hollerin' at my girl
Keepin' tha baton, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup just like me.
I'm the one, with them ones. 
Fuck the price on the tag 
Just throw it in the bag. 


Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Look at price tags
Where they do that at?
Heard that in ATL
When you wen' ATL
Just ask my baby girl
I treat my lady well
Ain't nothin' "soso"
But I know JD well
We in them Benzs, black, white, gray CL
Got niggas askin' did we miss a Mercedes sale?
Shit, I wish it was, but even though it wasn't,
We still doing donuts and I'm half a dozen,
They call me Krispy Kreme, my style is crispy clean
I drive some chicks on these crews, that's some crispy jeans
Ask how much?
Now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn,  what it look like?
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it so you get it
I gave shortie some till she say, oh I get it!
And now that you got it
Put it in the bag
Write your number down
Just put it on the tab.

Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say 'getchu1'

Like we breakin' down the weed
