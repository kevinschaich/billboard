Keri Hilson
Heh, not again
Ohh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Kanye West
Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have, dessert or disaster?

Keri Hilson
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in  and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' bout our life our house and kids, yeah
Every mornin' I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Ne-Yo
I never thought I'd, hear myself say, ooh, ya'll go 'head
I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today, kick it wit my girl today
I used to be commander-in-chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high, flyin' high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Oh shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashing, don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss Independent, ohh, to the fullest, the load never too much
She helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl sometimes love

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Kanye West
Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch?
Whoa, it's me, baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'mma ask him

Keri Hilson
Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will you bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh 'cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa, and if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens, hey
But when it happens you're gonna feel it
Let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
When it knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it
Let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
Yeah
