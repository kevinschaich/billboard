I go ooh ooh
You go ahh ahh
La la la la, Ah la la la
I can la la la la la la
I wanna wanna wanna get get get
What I want don't stop
Gimme gimme gimme what you got got
'Cuz I can't wait wait wait
Anymore more more more
Don't even talk about the consequence
'Cuz right now you're the only thing
That's makin' any sense to me
And I don't give a damn
What they say or what they think think
'Cuz you're the only one who's on my mind
I'll never ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever
Never wanna hear you say goodbye (bye bye)

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
I've gone crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched un
And I need you so much

See you breathe you I want to be you
Ah la la la, Ah la la la
You can take take t-t-take take time time
To live live the way
You gotta gotta live your life
Gimme gimme gimme all of you you
Don't be scared
I'll see you through the loneliness
I want it more more more
Don't even think about what's right or wrong
Or wrong or right
'Cuz in the end it's only you and me
And no one else is gonna be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be
So even if the world falls down today
You still got me to hold you up up
And I will never let you down (down down)

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
I've gone crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched un untouched
Untouched un untouched
Untouched un
Ah la la la, Ah la la la
Untouched un
Ah la la la, Ah la la la

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
I've gone crazy from the moment I met you

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
I've gone crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched un untouched
