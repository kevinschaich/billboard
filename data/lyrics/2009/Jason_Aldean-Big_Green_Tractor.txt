She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn’t get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
I just laughed and said ya’ll get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
I said whatcha wanna do baby I don’t care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here and

I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I’m with you it don’t matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you’d rather
I’ll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fire flies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house or

We can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I’m with you it really don’t matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you’d rather
I’ll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Mmm just let me dust off the seat
Mmm now put your pretty little arms around me

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you’ve got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you’d rather
I’ll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor
