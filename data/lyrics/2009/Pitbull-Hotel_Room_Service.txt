I want everybody to stop what they’re doin' (Mr. 305)
Now if you know you're with somebody
You're gonna take the hotel room tonight,
Make some noise (woo)

Meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room,
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room.

Two in the "O" and one in the eye
That kinky stuff, you nasty,
But I like your type
And like T.I., it's whatever you like.

Your man just left, I’m the plumber tonight,
I'll check yo' pipes, oh you the healthy type,
Well, here goes some egg whites.

That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon’ do.
Two plus two, I’m gon' undress you.

You gon’ undress me.

We gon’ freak some more, but first...

After party in hotel lobby,
Then we off to the room like vroom
Put them fingers in yo' mouth, or open up yo' blouse,
And pull that g-string down south

Ooh, okay shawty, one’s company,
Two’s a crowd and three’s a party.
Your girl ain’t with it, I got somebody
In my nature, she’s naughty.
