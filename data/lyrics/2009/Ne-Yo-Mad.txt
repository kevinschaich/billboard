Whoa uh ooh
Whoa uh ooh
Whoa uh ooh
Whoa uh
Mmmm

She's starin' at me 
I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin' 
Mmmmmm 
Nobody's talkin' 'cause talkin' just turns into screamin'
Ohhh

And now as I'm yellin' over her, she's yellin' over me 
All that that means 
Is neither of us are listening 
(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember why we're fighting. 

So both of us are mad for... 

Nothin' (fighting for) 
Nothin' (crying for) 
Nothin' (whooaaa) 
But we won't let it go for nothin'

(No not for)
Nothin' 
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got 
Ohhh baby... 

I know sometimes it's gonna rain 
But baby, can we make up now 
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain?
(Can't sleep through the pain) 

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed 
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me)

No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me) 
Ohhh no no no... 

And it gets me upset, girl 
When you're constantly accusing. 
(Askin' questions like you've already known) 
We're fighting this war, baby 
When both of us are losing. 
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)

Whoahhhh..... 
(What happened to workin' it out?) 
We've fall into this place 
Where you ain't backin' down and I ain't backin' down 
So what the hell do we do now... 

It's all for.. 

Nothin' (fighting for) 
Nothin' (crying for) 
Nothin' (whooaaa) 
But we won't let it go for 

Nothin'... 
(No not for) 
Nothin' 
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got 
Ohhh baby... 

I know sometimes it's gonna rain 
But baby, can we make up now 
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain 
(Can't sleep through the pain) 

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed 
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me)

No, I don't wanna go to bed 
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me) 
Ohhh no no no... 

Oh, baby this love ain't gonna be perfect 
(Perfect, perfect, ohh ohh) 
And just how good it's gonna be 
We can fuss and we can fight,
Long as everything's all right between us... 
Before we go to sleep. 

Baby, we're gonna be happy. 

Baby, I know sometimes it's gonna rain 
but baby, can we make up now 
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain 
(Can't sleep through the pain) 

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed 
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me)

No, I don't wanna go to bed 
(Mad at you) 
And I don't want you to go to bed 
(Mad at me) 
Ohhh no no no...
