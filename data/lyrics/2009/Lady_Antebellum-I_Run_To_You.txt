I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

Whoa-oh-whoa
Oh, I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you, I run to you, yeah

Whoa-oh-whoa
Oh, I run to you
I run to you girl
Whoa-oh-whoa
