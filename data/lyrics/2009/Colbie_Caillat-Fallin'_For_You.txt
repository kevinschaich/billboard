I don't know but
I think I maybe
Fallin' for you
Dropping so quickly

Maybe I should
Keep this to myself
Waiting till I
Know you better

I am trying
Not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of
Holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance

All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying
Not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
So I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of
Holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you

I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

Oh I just can't take it
My heart is racin'
Emotions keep spinnin' out

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life

And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you

I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you

I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you

I'm fallin' for you

Ooohhh
Oh no no
Oooooohhh
Oh I'm fallin' for you
