I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas please
Fold 'em let 'em hit me raise it baby stay with me, I love it
LoveGame intuition play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me, I love it
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough, it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
(Mum mum mum mah)
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
(She's got to love nobody)
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
