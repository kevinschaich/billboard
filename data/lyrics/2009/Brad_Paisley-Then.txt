I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn’t told you yet, but I thought I loved you then

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There people around but I didn’t care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it’s ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning grey
What I can’t see is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I’ve said that before

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
We’ll look back someday, at this moment that we’re in 
And I’ll look at you and say, "and I thought I loved you then"
And I thought I loved you then
