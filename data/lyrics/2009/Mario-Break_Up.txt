When I kiss you so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this loving is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When I hit that so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feeling is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?

Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I been driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

(Verse: Gucci Mane)
Now baby girl just dumped me
She no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired
She says that I've been fired
On to the next one
More fish in the sea
Girls are like buses
Miss one, next 15 one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stunnin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL
She used to be my soulja

(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louis
(Don't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze
(Don't) Don't when I dive I dive deep?

I know I be, gone
I know I be, gone
I know I be, (flirtin with them girls)
I know I be, said I'd be right there, but take too long.
I know I be, saying I be faithful but I don't
I know I be,

Making you them promises
Then breaking you're heart again
Telling you she wasn't, who she was
Then we argueing, but babyyyy (I love you)

Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I been driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I been driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

You might be familiar
But to me girl you' a model,
Everything that I e-ever seen in a model,
If you're leaving baby, don't leave me till tommorow
Tonight we gon' get a little tipsy, with a bottle.

You gonna get me up'
I'm a take 'em down
I'm a change my ways
We gon' work it out
Girl I wouldn't be the same if you was with somebody else
Girl it wouldn't be the same if I was with somebody else

I know I made mistakes before,
Promise you won't get hurt no more,
I got what you like and you know
Once you lay down, It's on .

Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?

Bein icy ain't easy, I make it look easy,
You should cop you a Bally
