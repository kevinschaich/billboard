Lil Wayne
I like a long hair, thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'ma own that pussy
Gon throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick, now come here, lemme dope you
You gon' be a dopefiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Unh, but you can call me tune'che
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on phonics, yeah
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it
And watch it (back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

(Chorus)
Cuz we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too
And ohhh

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (x3)

Drake
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again, we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am, let's be honest (she wants me she wants me)
Cuz I got it all shawty, tell me what you don't see
I would fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say pussy pussy pussy
And weed and alcohol seems to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of stayin' wit her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

(Chorus)

Jae Millz
I ain't bein' disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every house of Diddy chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Will so married woman and MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss you-can-get-the-business, hah

Gutta
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'ma call all y'all
My butter pecan, Puerto Rican
She screamin' out papi everytime a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too boy, I gets my pimpin' on

(Chorus)
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (x8)

Mack Maine
Sanna Lathan, Megan Good
Angelina Jolie, D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no, not at all
Kit-kat a midget, if that ass soft, I break her off
I exchange v-cards with the retards
And get behind the christian like d.r. 
Cuz he are, Mack Mizzoo, baby
Cuz he are, Mack Mizzoo baby

Lil Wayne
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (x4)
