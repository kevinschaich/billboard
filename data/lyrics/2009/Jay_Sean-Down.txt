Baby, are you down down down down down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
Down, down (oh)

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)
Baby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

So baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)
Baby, are you down down down down down? (down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down

Lil Wayne
Down like she supposed to be, she gets down low for me
Down like her temperature, 'cause to me she zero degrees
She cold, like overfreeze, I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America, now can I be her soldier, please

I'm fighting for this girl on a battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sent his arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly I'm down like the economy, yeah
