Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

I tried my best at movin' on, have yet to find a girl like you
See things now, I didn't before now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about then never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

Baby all that I hear from my friends again, again and again (They come and ask about you, they say)
We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't go to sleep, can't think, can't eat
'Til I come see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

(Interlude from Ludacris)

Look,
Now it's been about a year 
And I'm tryin' to figure out, how could ya
Forget about who loves you the most, why would ya

Heal my heart, heal my brain and
Oh how I wish you could feel my pain
Cause I couldn't get you off my mind, if I tried

Twenty-four/seven, three six five,
And my nights so cold, days so long
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Well it's gone and I'm trippin', how much I miss it
And you steady walkin' round, like I never existed,
And it's hard to understand, you got another plan
Tryin' to play hard, that you got another man,

But you'll never find another like moi,
That'll ridin' you round in a drop-top car
Baby you're a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we sow it

LUDA!
