Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants, no trace, 
No residual feelings within you
One day you won't remember me.

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love you.
I hope you feel the same.

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affection 
Had to fill out my prescription for the remedy
I had to set you free.

Away from me
To see clearly
The way that love can be 
When you are not with me
I had to live
I had to live
I had to leave
I had to leave

If I can't have you
Let love set you free 
To flap your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.

I came wrong you were right 
Transformed your love into "like"
Baby believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies.
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times 
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times
Better days, and I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free 
To flap your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.
