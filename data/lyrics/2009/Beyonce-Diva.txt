Stop the track, let me state facts 
I told you give me a minute, and I'll be right back 
Fifty million 'round the world and they said that I couldn't get it 
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis I can't spend 
How you gon' be talkin' shit? 
You act like I just got up in it 
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute 
I know you read the paper, the one that they call a queen 
Every radio 'round the world know me 
'Cause that's where I be

Getting money, divas getting money

Since fifteen in my stilettos been struttin' in this game 
What's yo age was the question they asked when I hit the stage 
I'm a diva, best believe her
You see her, she getting paid
She ain't callin him to greet her
Don't need him, her bed's made

This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags uh that money
A stick up, stick up
You see the mask where that money 
All my ladies get it up

Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane
